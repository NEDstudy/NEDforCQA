      <detail>19 Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt.     20 There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.     21 So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

Or do you think they will inevitably shut the schools?  **personal note: I go to school in Brooklyn, live in Manhattan, and have an important bio test tomorrow...no clue how I can get there without buses or the subway (especially if they are considering shutting bridges - means even the expensive option of taking a taxi is useless).</detail>

      <title>Normal NATO Gas Mask vs. Carbon Monoxide Question!?</title>
      <detail>How would normal NATO and military gas mask stand against carbon monoxide and smoke from fires? I know that gas mask filters any poisons, toxins, or dangerous chemicals out of the surrounding air, but would it protect a user in an environment with a carbon monoxide leak or against the fumes and smoke from a fire that could usually suffocate a person without any protection? Or would SCBA oxygen tank-masks be overall superior to gas masks for surviving all of the above and all types of oxygen dangers and problems? Thanks!</detail>
      <category>Science &amp; Mathematics;Chemistry</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>An escape smoke hood with a catalyst filter or the SCBA for carbon monoxide. The SCBA is better because it uses its own oxygen source but generally don't last as long as a gas mask filter. And no gas filter protects against everything. If you have a high quality one then most hazards, yes.</answer>

        <answer>Of course they should.   The radicals, led by extremist 1.414213 and 1.73205 have seen an increase in traffic; and have succeeded in recruiting the biological weapons expert 12. In light of these recent developments, our nation has to be prepared: even whole, natural numbers can be turned to a radical number by the correct manipulation.</answer>

        <answer>First they came for the transcendentals, and I did not speak out because I am not transcendental.  Then they came for the irrationals, and I did not speak out because I am not irrational.  Then they came for the rationals, and I did not speak out because I am not rational.  Then they came for the integers, and who was left to speak for me?  0.    (Excuse the slight mathematical liberties taken, and with apologies to Pastor Martin Neimuller)</answer>

      <title>Best driving route - UK, France, Spain, S. France, Italy, Switz, Holland, UK?</title>
      <detail>Hey all,    We're planning a driving trip around Europe in June for about 5 weeks. We want to drive from London, through France maybe down to San Sebastian, over to Barca, all round the South of France into Italy. Down Italy to Napoli, then back up to Zurich via Milan. Then finally on to Amsterdam and back to London.       We have google maps our route but obviously I'm sure there are some much nice routes to take. Has anyone done this route before? How long did it take, cost etc? We really want to find a nice route that someone may have already done and follow it so not to get too lost but I can't find anything on the web that actually shows the route on a map?      Any help would be greatly appreciated.</detail>

        <answer>There are so many possible routes that it is impossible to give you a 'best' route. Also because we do not know your wishes and likes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; How many hours do you want to drive, how much of your driving do you want to drive on the motorway and how big a percentage on the small roads.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Where do you want to stay for your travels, do you like to go into big cities, stay in motels on the edge of the cities or do you want to stay in the small villages in old fashioned inns and home stays.&lt;...</answer>
        <answer>London to France is the only ferry route there is from england to Europe so if you want to go back to england by car i suggested you don't go Holland because then you'll need a floating car or drive all the way back to France. I don't know al these European routes just ask Google Earth. and you'll note down the route your taking from city to city.</answer>

      <category>Travel;Asia Pacific;Taiwan</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>It is called the Republic of China (ROC) because that is the name of the government that currently administers the island under the authority of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender document signed by the Allied Powers in 1945 at the conclusion of WW2, and as authorized by the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers (Gen. MacArthur, of the USA). The territory has never been formally assigned to any government, and by internationa law and conventions remains under "US Military Government Jurisdiction"...</answer>
        <answer>rustyjohnlloyd is wrong. Taiwan has never been part of China.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Taiwan is the ROC because the Kuomintang enforced authoritarian rule in Taiwan when they arrived in 1949 establishing themselves as government, hence CREATING A SEPARATE ENTITY. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Taiwan is separate but China wants Taiwan's prosperous economy so they maintain a claim, despite the Paiwan incident of 1871 leading to China explicitly saying "they have no jurisdiction in Taiwan."&lt;br&gt;  Subsequently Taiwan was ruled by ...</answer>

        <answer>Because it WAS a part of China, Taiwan was separated from the main China when communists take over the position of nationalists. The Communist were the Red Giants led by Mao Ze Dong (Mao Tse Tung) while the Nationalists were led by Chiang Kai Shek. The communists stayed at the main China, the current china while nationalists stayed at Taiwan. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  BTW . . .&lt;br&gt;  Taiwan = Republic of China &lt;br&gt;  while&lt;br&gt;  China = People's Republic of China</answer>

        <answer>Ummm... not sure if it is worth it. There is a charge to drive on it. It is just basically a residential area with big old gated homes set back. It is beautiful but I think you could avoid it and just drive or bike down Ocean View Blvd. in Pacific Grove and then check out Pt. Lobos just south of Carmel and get the same kind of beauty. I would think you could find a bike rental place either in Carmel or Monterey.</answer>
        <answer>William M's answer is true. There are some beautiful homes along the 17-mile drive for sure. There are some pretty vista as well. its like $8.50 per car to enter the drive. I think to drive along cannery row and into Pacific Grove is a more stunningly scenic drive and it is free! Its my favorite part of the state and is truly beautiful.</answer>
        <answer>We love driving along the 17 Mile Drive from time to time (not much into biking it though) for the views of the ocean and the beautiful homes.      But, if you're going to bike, I think Ocean View Blvd. in Pacific Grove (as a previous poster suggested) would be a better (&amp; safer) bet.      We also love Pt.

By the evening most of them will be closed but in central parts of the city there should be plenty of those who are working through evening and probably even night. You'll be able to easily find them, they are literally almost on every corner and are easy to notice - banners (usually yellow)...</answer>
        <answer>Lucky you visiting Kiev. Its one of the nicest cities in europe for all kinds of reasons.&lt;br&gt;  As others have said avoid changing money at Boryispol airport.You will get ripped off.  Also at the airport do expect a long wait at passport control and customs and make sure you fill your landing card in before you join the que at passport control. Fill in your customs declaration in the arrivals hall.  Wait until you get into the centre and change dollars for Hryvna either at a bank or one of the st...</answer>
        <answer>You may exchange your dollars in banks or in currency exchange points, there are plenty of them in Kiev. I just wouldn't recommend to do the exchange in airport - the exchange rate is usually somewhat low there. As an option, you might exchange a minimum required amount in an airport and buy more hryvnas next day.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Dollars are not usually accepted in shops etc. You might be able to negotiate to pay with dollars in taxi etc, but it is strongly not recommended as the exchange rate will b...</answer>

      <title>Who do you think is a better author: Michael Crichton or James Patterson?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;Books &amp; Authors</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I haven't read James Patterson, so I really couldn't say. I am a great admirer of Michael Crichton. But I think it's difficult to actually say that one author is better than another--it tends to come down to personal preference. I think there's plenty of room on the bookshelf for both of them.</answer>
        <answer>I think Crichton was a better suspense writer; I particularly enjoyed his sci-fi stuff.  However, Patterson has many hats (mystery, romance, suspense, teens) and for that I have to give him credit.</answer>
        <answer>James Patterson.  I love his work.</answer>
        <answer>Hhmmm....Well, I love them both, but I would have to say the late Michael Crichton...because he was so creative in so many genres...science fiction, medical thrillers, movie screenplays, television series (created E.R.)...PLUS, he was a medical doctor...James Patterson is good, but he is good for a very formulamatic crime novel or a sappy love story, unless he collaborates with someone else!    (Not intending to insult any fans....)</answer>

Is there any way to fix it? it has a huge scratch around the disk so I guess that's why it doesn't work. I heard tooth paste fixes it? anyways, if you can't atleast help me download some stuff??

        <answer>Just go back to the store whenever (doesn't have to be now) and ask for a refund, or complain for a new one. There's no way to fix a scratched disc. Doesn't matter what Xbox you have. Maybe also check the console the disc uses. Are you sure you bought it for Xbox and not PS3 or PC?</answer>
        <answer>If you're talking about fixing it right now? No, nothing at your home will fix it...unless you have a resurface machine..in that case, if you did, you would know enough not to have to come on here. Go to a local video store, or video game store and more often than not they can resurface it for pretty cheap.  But, it's a redbox game, so I'd just call and ***** about it and get your money back.

      <category>Travel;Europe (Continental);Netherlands</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I spent a few weeks in Haarlem some years back and loved it.  Walked everywhere day and night with no trouble.  I had heard that Amsterdam had become quite unsafe with gangs of Muslim boys.  It's hard to think of Haarlem being anything but charming.  So sad it has gotten like that!</answer>
        <answer>Where i live in, amsterdam, i think its safe. I even TRY to walk around at night, because amsterdam is simply beautiful, (well, the city centre is, haha :D ) at night time, and in the summer, taking a stroll on a pleasant, warm evening is rather refreshing. About Eindhoven and Haarlem, i can't answer that because ive never seen the place at night, but Utrecht doesn't seem dangerous, quite a quaint little town.</answer>
        <answer>I live in Eindhoven, happened to me that I started walking at 3 am. nothing happened, but it really depends on the part of the city you are in. in the city center nothing will happen to you. but you gotta be more careful in living areas</answer>
        <answer>In general it's going to be safer than most major cities in north America. But, like any country there's some no go areas in the cities and there's always groups of drunks looking for trouble.</answer>

        <answer>Since it takes 8 or 9 months from launch to get there, we would have to launch today, or in a month, which means the space craft has to have been built already, and the rocket has to be at the launch site ready to be fueled and launched.

        <answer>It's Switzerland, but it's one of the main airport for some of the ski resorts in France, so it's easy to see how confusion could arise.  However, that person who said it's in France is WRONG!  I should know - I sold flights there for over 25 years</answer>
        <answer>The Geneva airport is located in Switzerland at the French border. It has road acces from/to both countries. Before Switzerland joined Schengen in 2008/2009 you were able to either enter Switzerland or France through the Geneva airport. Nowadays this is no longer important since the borders between France and Switzerland are open based on the Schengen agreement [however still controlled by customs officers since Switzerland is not a member of the EU/EEA]. On arrival at Geneva airport you can sti...</answer>
        <answer>The Geneva airport is in Switzerland near the French border. It's mostly used for visiting French-speaking destinations. From the airport it's easy to go anywhere in the western part of Switzerland by car or train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about the Geneva airport and other airports in Switzerland at the following website:</answer>
        <answer>What makes you so sure there is a clear and simple answer? The border between France and Switzerland more or less runs through the airport.

        <answer>The easiest approach:    pV/T = p'V'/T'    Just remember that T is expected to mean ABSOLUTE temperature, in the equation above.  Convert back to C when done.  Therefore,    T' = T  p'/p  V'/V = 300  46.2/499  2.72/ 0.1013 = 745.8 K    In C, 745.8 - 273.2 = 472.6 C.    Notice that, except temperature, the other quantities involved are ratios.  This can be used to advantage; for instance, I took pressure as being in MPa.  As long as you use the same units for both quantities, you may use whatever...</answer>
        <answer>Now, the prior answer is probably the one your teacher is looking for. But if you really wanted to nail this, you would need to know the cam profile. The reason is that the exhaust valve doesn't close at bottom dead center. It is open until 70-75 degrees after bottom dead center. So some of the air at the beginning of the compression stroke gets pushed out of the exhaust valve rather than being compressed. You need to know the bore, cam timing, and conrod length to calculate the volume at the ac...</answer>

        <answer>Did you check out the tuition at Northwestern?  In 2009, the tuition and room and board was about $50,000 per year.  They do not give out scholarships of any kind. very little financial aid.  The cost difference between these two school is going to be extreme. for Northwestern you are going to need a 30+ on your ACT and a high GPA. Evanston is a great town with a lot of character. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I live near the school. (and I lived in phoenix) You will be seeing snow if you come here. and very cold...</answer>
        <answer>Born and raised Illinois native here... If you've never seen snow, our winters will strike you as utterly insane. It will snow from November through March, if not longer, and the temperature ranges from chilly to "colder than Alaska" for about half of the year. The other half ranges from temperate, to hot and sticky. You get used to it, but I'm guessing it will take you a while. Let's put it this way, I moved farther East to Ohio for college.

        <answer>Pretty much anything James Patterson has written or co-authored is great!  I have all of his books and I could not put them down  :)  Anything with Alex Cross is great but it's best to start reading him from the beginning since each book tends to add to his story a bit more.  Happy reading!!</answer>
        <answer>Anything in the Alex Cross series is good.  I also just read the Lifeguard and it was really good and suspensful!</answer>
        <answer>my first James Patterson book wasn't part of any of his series.  I read Cradle and All, it was about 2 teen pregnancies, both were claimed to have been "devine" (such as Mary's pregnancy with Jesus) however it's not overly religious.  I read it all in about 9 hours, I couldn't put it down!!!!!</answer>
        <answer>All his stuff is excellent.  I would recommend The Jester if you havent read it already.  If so, The Lake House or either of the Maximum Ride books are great.  Alex Cross is also an excellent suggestion</answer>

        <answer>No.    Civilian deaths are down 36%  We have been killing and detaining terrorists on a daily basis  There have been less and less terrorist attacks since the troop surge    If this war is going to last for 'years', then I think some of the parliament should get some vacation time...but not a month...that is way too long to be away from the duties of your country...especially when that country is in its beginning stages.</answer>

      <title>Do you think Clinton, Stalone, Cassius Clay have the right to walk among our fallen at Arlington Cemetary?</title>
      <detail>Bill clinton said he loathed the miltary. Cassiut Clay claimed he was a muslim and Stalone fled to Europe to coach a girls volleyball team. Is this right?</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Absolutely Not!  Such people, if even allowed on the hallowed ground of Arlington, should crawl thru the cemetary and kiss the headstones of the brave men and women who have paid for them to live in a free country.</answer>
        <answer>Yes they do.  Those buried at Arlington traded their lives (and in many cases gave their lives) fulfilling their oaths to the Constitution.  It is that same Constitution that gives those people the right to walk among those hallowed dead.</answer>
        <answer>Cassius Clay did not "claim" to be a Muslim.  He is a Muslim, and he was willing to go to prison because of his belief that it would be wrong for him to join the military.  He put his money where his mouth was.    Why don't you mention the illustrious heroic military service of our current president and vice-president?  How many deferments did Cheney receive?</answer>
        <answer>Using your stated criteria for Bill Clinton (you may have other reasons you have not posted), Abe Lincoln and Jimmy Carter shouldn't be allowed to 'walk among our fallen' either.  To claim that past Commander in Chiefs should be banned from a public national cemetery due to statements they made borders on ridiculous.    The right to ask for release from military service due to religious convictions goes to the core of what our country was based on, freedom.  I do not know if Muhammad Ali/Cassius...</answer>
        <answer>Yes, they all have the right.  Each one is entitled to his convictions.  You do live in the USA, don't you? I thought that was the kind of thing that makes you proud of your country.</answer>

Note that this is coming from a native Texan, so it's not out-of-state sour grapes.

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Travel;Air Travel</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I know US Airways has issued a travel advisory to Mexico and will change your flights to different dates or allow you to change your destination at no charge. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  So you can't get a refund, but you can apply the value of your ticket to a ticket somewhere else, or postpone your trip and hope that the swine flu threat ends quickly. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I imagine most other airlines have similar policies.</answer>
        <answer>No, the airlines will not refund your ticket, they will just waive all change fees by May 6th. That means that you can travel anywhere else but Mexico and the airline will apply your  FULL fare towards that travel. If the travel is less, then you can get either a travel credit or a portion of the fare refunded depending on if it's a refundable fare or not. If it's more, then you will pay the difference.</answer>

        <answer>this is a "warning", not a restriction of air travel. you will not get reimbursed if you cancel your flights if you chose to do so.</answer>

      <title>Events like VT shooting happen everyday in Baghdad so why don't we care about what's going on Iraq?</title>
      <detail>Is this a case of Not In My Backyard?  Seems to me that people are so narrowly focused on their lives and fail to connect with tragedies that happen every day around the world.  Are Americans insensitive to what's going on in the rest of the world?</detail>
      <category>News &amp; Events;Current Events</category>

        <answer>Because people have become de-sensitized by the inhuman brutality that is occurring there.  It is too horrifying to comprehend.  People don't think they can do anything about it, other than vote for a different president.  I say prayers for all sides in the conflict and hope that all parties concerned, particularly differing parties within Iraq, can come to some kind of compromise and work together.  This ia a much more sane choice than trying to intimidate the other side into submission with ho...</answer>
        <answer>Your question is too generalized? I live in Jamaica and i feel so sorry for the killings happening in the rest of the world.     Have you ever stop to think what the thousands of people in America that does not support the war in Iraq have to go through when persons like yourself class them as "Heart-less"?</answer>
        <answer>People in Iraq need to reach out to each other. This is what Americans do when tragedy happens.  In times of tragedy in the United States there is no racial barriers or ethnic questions it is a helping hand. We are not interested in religious backgrounds or church attendance, just the sadness that strikes our nation. People in Iraq could learn from this model. We try to solve the problems that come our way, not wait for someone else to do it for us.</answer>
        <answer>do you want everyone to hold a vigil 24/7?  who says we don't care about the casualties over in iraq?  lives are expected to be lost in a war but we don't expect someone to go to a college and mow down 32 people....</answer>
        <answer>because the war in Iraq has going been on for years. The VT shootings happened in one morning and killed people's friends and family cold and heartless without even a emotion from the shooter!</answer>

        <answer>I agree with you. It was against his religion to fight in the ring for money. But he did. That didn't bother anybody at the time. He didn't want to fight for his country. Ironically the Army would not have wasted his skills and would not have put him in combat. He was an amazing boxer. He should be admired for that and nothing else. That was his only claim to be "the greatest". The worst thing was how the "Black Muslims" exploited him for money. They had him in the ring long after he should have...</answer>

        <answer>Cassius Clay (Muhammed Ali) had every right to refuse military service...he failed the ARMY entrance exam. Despite that the Army still tried to induct him.   The US Supreme Court eventually sided with Clay ruling that the Army could not convict him of draft evasion.    The rest was all publicity and and a smoke screen to cover up Ali's failure to pass the Army exam.</answer>

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Travel;Canada;Toronto</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Toronto is safer then Vancouver by a long shot. I lived only 2 hours away from Toronto and had to visit every second weekend for doctor appointment and never had any problems. My best friend lived only one block from me and moved to Vancouver 5 years ago and has told me many scary stories about his stay there and if his job would permit him he said he would work outta Toronto any day......Look up the crime rate and compare them against each other...good luck &amp; stay safe.</answer>
        <answer>Toronto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vancouver has a gang war right now., while in Toronto, it's mostly concentrated at Jane/Finch area, as well as Malvern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're moving to Toronto's suburbs, then pick the safest ones like Mississauga and Caledon: Mississauga is Canada's safest large city, while Caledon is Canada's safest "city" of all sizes (Caledon is a town).</answer>
        <answer>Depends when you go....If you go to Vancouver when they're losing in the playoffs, there's bound to be some riots...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, I feel like Toronto is the safer of the two. I've travelled to both and in Toronto I didn't feel like people were watching me just to see when it would be easiest to steal my belongings.</answer>

        <answer>The Mercedes will most likely be the most reliable( the 2.4 is very good) and with the supercharger, quite quick as well, but if you want a true luxury British saloon you can't go past the Jag, it's just stunning, and a bit more exclusive than the Benz, at least over here in Australia. Might not be as reliable but just look at the dam thing, its beautiful. Just as luxurious if not more so than the Merc as well. Don't think I don't like the Merc, i own one for god sakes ( 1983 380SEL ), its a gre...</answer>

        <answer>I thought they usually play the third course at Poppy Hills?  which traditionally is the easiest of the three.  So I don't know much about Monterey.  Pebble is of course the most famous and has more ocean exposure.  When wind picks up it will be the hardest course, but without the wind the pros will eat it up.  Spyglass in contrast is a technical nightmare, consistently one of the most difficult courses on the tour.

You get a sub-par education in the vast majority of their programs. You're thinking of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne. Unless you're planning on majoring in nursing or have a specific program in mind where UIC is actually decent (there are very few), Northwestern is almost always the better choice. That said, it's a p...</answer>
        <answer>You will get an excellent education at UIC.  The UIC of today is very different than what it was in our parent's day.  The programs will prepare you well.  There is no hand holding here.  Also, there is no grade inflation unlike at UIUC.  It is a commuter school.  There is not a lot of merit aid.  Most of the financial aid is loan based.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People seem to forget certain important facts about academic profile of UIC.

      <title>Does America use Interpol's "worst of" list to block certain websites?</title>
      <detail>The Australian Government has backed down from a plan to force all ISPs to block a secret list of potentially millions of internet sites. It seems to have been hit over the head by reality and listened to public opinion. Instead, ISPs will be required only to block Interpol's "worst of" list, a matter of only a few hundred internationally-agreed sites which constitute abject abuse.   I'm curious, though, whether America, a member of Interpol, blocks the sites on this list as well. I've done some googling, looked at Interpol's site as well as the USDOJ's Washington Interpol site, but haven't come up with an answer.</detail>

        <answer>One. Why does it matter? At least people are learning one way or another.    Two. Some do, yes. Some older people probably didn't know of him, either; so let's not generalize.  -x-  Alright, just making sure.  Personally, I knew of him because I work very closely with the gay rights center downtown and HRC, but not everyone does. This was a good film to open the eyes of many.</answer>

      <category>Travel;Europe (Continental);Netherlands</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Indeed if you do not wish to exit passport control (wise decision especially at this time of the year when it is very busy in the terminals at Schiphol and 5 hours is not long), then no you do not need a transit visa (although a multi-entry Schengen visa with no restrictions would have covered that for you anyway).    Schiphol is actually a nice airport - there is plenty to keep you occupied - many resturants including the Panarama one where you can sit and watch the planes take off and land, ea...</answer>
        <answer>Since you travel to Norway, you must have a Schengen visa, being an Indian citizen. Check your visa for any country limitations. If there aren't any and you are authorized to travel all Schengen countries, you are good to go. Otherwise you will have to stay in the transit area of the Airport and cannot pass the Durch customs.</answer>
        <answer>As Norway is in  the Schengen Area, the flight from Schiphol is likely in the 'no passport control zone'.    So coming from India you will have to pass the passport control before being able to catch that flight.    As I have never flown within the Schengen area I am not sure, but I think you better check, also whether your visa allows you to enter the Schengen Zone in the Netherlands.</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>He doesn't debate.  He interrupts.</answer>
        <answer>This is easy...Politicians won't do it because Limbaugh is NOT running for office. News anchors won't do it because they are afraid of being boxed into a corner by him for their own screw ups...To them it's okay to put someone else's dirty laundry out in the public eye, but they do not want their own to be made public.  I hope that sums it up in a nutshell. That's how I see it anyway...None of these reporters are saints in my book.</answer>
        <answer>My liberal brother said one word when I mentioned Rush to him: "poison" and as I thought about it I realized that Rush is poison to the liberals and that is why they won't debate him.  The late Tim Russert invited him to be on NBC on election night in 2000 and he surprised them with a yes.  Since no other media organization dares invite him for fear he would accept.</answer>
        <answer>Because it would have to be on his show, where he sets the rules, previews the questions, and controls who is allowed to speak and when.       Only an idiot would agree to "debate" under such a rigged system.</answer>

Really, once you've seen your first 10 or so cathedrals, the experience begins to pall.

(You dont have to read all this) She said she really needs the money, she hates her nose and wants to get a nose job by the time she's 25, and if you pose for Playboy you do get paid a lot.  I do not want thousands of random guys looking at MY girlfriend nude, the thought of it makes me sick and sad, she is SO beautiful (her nose is fine!!!) and has a rockin body, but that doesn't mean she should pose nude for money.  She keeps saying but you used to look at those magazines and watch porn, how can you tell me I can't pose for a magazine!? She doesn't think posing nude is porn because she isn't having sex with someone, but by definition posing nude is a form of pornography, something she wrote a 17 page long letter to the president about making illegal.  Is there any way I can stop her? Should I just let her do it??  Please don't make any jokes I'm serious about this, this is my girlfriend who I want to spend the rest of my life with.

        <answer>I am not sure if it is on the sheet music book "And Winter Came", that music book does exist but I am just not sure if that bonus piece is there. However, the melody is exactly the same as on "One Toy Soldier", only the lyrics are different, so you might be able to play the song by using the actual sheet music for "One Toy Soldier".

      <detail>This is a school laptop, hence the windows 7 oa OS they sell these in large quantities. I need to reformat myself otherwise I'd have to pay a fee out of my own pocket. These OS are really annoying, I don't have an admin password, It'd be cool if I found a way to turn myself into an admin, but so far most of the methods through RUN etc. do not work. As far as reformatting is concerned, I'm getting disk errors and what not when I boot from a disk, but from the desktop I pop in the w7 disk and it again asks me for a password..  So is there anyway I could turn myself into an admin? or anyway I can reformat this harddrive?</detail>

      <detail>Is there a difference between how the National Weather Service and Television broadcasters operate their Doppler radars?    It seems when the television networks are showing their radar data, it updates within a couple of minutes. From my rudimentary understanding of how current weather radar technology works, there should be a 5-10 minute delay due to the listening period after the radio signal is sent.     Thanks.</detail>

        <answer>As I understand it, the listening period isn't on the order of minutes, but on the order of milliseconds. The pulse sent generally is not a radio signal, it's microwave, which of course moves at the speed of light to hit whatever particle of precipitation it's going to hit, and then reflects back to the radar very quickly (not the speed of light, but relatively close to it).      I think the main difference between tv station radars and the NWS radars is that the NWS releases their radar returns...</answer>

      <title>Anyone found an effective solution for Government Thought Policing: The NSA and Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM)?</title>
      <detail>The following information was evidence provided in a civil suit against the federal government in the case Akewi v. NSA (92-0449). John St. Clair Akewi is a former National Security Agency employee and whistle-blower who exposed the use of neural monitoring to spy on individuals. The Signals Intelligence mission of the NSA has evolved into a program of decoding EMF waves in the environment for wirelessly tapping into computers and tracking persons with the electrical currents in their bodies.      (Source)      How The National Security Agency (NSA) Illegally And Unconstitutionally Harasses Law-Abiding Americans Everyday. How, you ask? Quite simply, actually. It’s done by EMF or ELF Radio Waves, and a technology known as “Remote Neural Monitoring”. Haven’t you ever wondered about that ringing in your left ear? Well, here are the reason(s). And just why should the NSA do this, you ask? To silence any who who dare to speak out against them or any other agency, or the Government or simply to think for themselves, and “outside the box”, if you will. Think not? Then, read on……….    Blanket coverage of all electronic communication in the U.S. and the world to ensure national security. The NSA at Ft. Meade, Maryland has had the most advanced computers in the world since the early 1960’s.

You might like Norah Jones as well .. pianistic, jazz. Also Bob James ... neither is really the same style as Geo. Winston, but it's pleasant music all the same.

      <title>Flat and job in Cardiff/Wales?</title>
      <detail>Hi, I'm going to graduate with the German equivalent of A-levels in about a month and I've been learning Welsh for some time already, so I thought moving to Cardiff would be nice, as it's a nice big city to get to know people and gain some money, language and working experience. So my questions are the following:      1. What's the best way to find a flat? I thought about Gumtree and all, but probably it's best to go there for some days and just have a look at them, right? You never know. So, what do I have to take care of? I've never lived on my own so far, and I'm afraid there could be some minor language problems, like oops - some little misunderstanding and I'll be stuck with some awful messy room or anything... :-D   2. What prices do I have to expect? I read in a university prospectus that I have to calculate about 50-75￡/week, is that correct? Where are the cheaper/more expensive areas to live in Cardiff?    3. Certainly I want to gain some working experience too, so I would take some part-time jobs to finance the flat and all. Could you advise me any jobs that are easy to get, like working at a bar, in a supermarket, cinema, pizza service etc.? And what wage can I expect, would I even be able to cover my living expenses?   4. Are the people friendly and caring? :-) Well, I've met some Cardiffians already, they are all nice and try helping me as good as they can, so I don't really doubt this.      Sorry, that's a lot, I know :-D But I just need to make sure I'll do the right thing...</detail>

If I were you, I'd start ringing some letting agencies, or looking at websites. Just type in 'rent, flat, cardiff' and see what comes up. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  2. A one bedroom flat in Cardiff can cost around ￡450- ￡500 a month. I'd recommend that you maybe find a room in a shared house, or a flatshare. That would...</answer>

      <title>New Bahrain labour law stirs hornet's nest?</title>
      <detail>Bahrain's move to become the first Gulf state to scrap the controversial sponsorship system for expatriates, likely to be hailed by rights activists, has sparked concerns among the business community and the federation of trade unions.      Labour Minister Majeed Al Allawi on Monday said Bahrain would implement a new labour law on August 1 that allows foreign workers to switch jobs without their existing employer's consent. "This is the end of the sponsorship system, which does not differ much from slavery," the minister said.The new law, a major demand by human rights activists, allows foreign workers to move to new jobs simply by informing their existing employers of their intention to end the contract. The notice should be made through registered mail and according to the timeframe stipulated in the employment contract, but must not exceed three months.      "The new employer will then register the worker with the labour authorities, but he or she will have to produce the end of contract notice sent to the former employer," Al Allawi said.      According to the minister, the new law, applicable to both the public and private sectors, guarantees the rights of the employers and employees.      "The law definitely improves the working conditions in Bahrain, will help increase salaries and wages and will eliminate the infamous free visa practice," said Al Allawi, a former opposition figure who was given the labour portfolio in 2002. "The application of this law will also boost the chances of Bahrainis getting jobs since employers will no longer be able to force expatriates to stay on and will put an end to the practice by some people who bring in workers and dump them in the market in return for monthly fees."</detail>

August 1 is the day when it would be implemented. Its a very good and far reaching change and makes the expats on par with the citiizens in terms of law.

        <answer>Bahrain is still studying this and it is not a final say on the matter. The scrapping of sponsorship as it currently exists was not originally a Bahrain initiative, it was put forward before by former UAE minister Al Ka'abi who suggested such a move, by making the sponsorships go thru a unified government labor agency / authority that would regulate this directly for foreign workers, in order to combat abuse of the system by some shady foreign business owners who use it as a cover for human traf...</answer>

      <title>Why Do Stock Prices Matter?</title>
      <detail>I saw a vid on youtube saying that stock price is just the value of the company, and it doesn't actually do anything to expand business and pay employees and that companies use their operating income to do these things. because the businesses aren't allowed to use the money gained by stock. He basically said it just sits there  Ultimately he was trying to say capital gains tax shouldn't be lesser than ordinary income tax? But that doesn't seem to make any sense to me, can someone explain why stock prices matter?

        <answer>The stock price tells the value of the company. The more valuable the stocks of a company are, the happier the investors are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes companies by other companies with their own stocks. So if the value of a stock is high, there is need for less stocks to change owner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a compay's stock price goes very low, some other company may buy that whole company, which is not that nice for the one beeing bought if they wish to stay independent.</answer>
        <answer>You are misunderstanding what he said. He means the money that people pay for stocks doesn't go to the company because it goes to the person selling the stocks. This is called a secondary market. Companies get money from stocks in what is called the primary market. This is when a company does and IPO. They decide how many shares they want to sell and what % of the company it will represent and they sell it to anyone willing to buy. They get the proceeds from that sale.

      <title>Advice on Germany (Berlin vs Frankfurt/Rhine)?</title>
      <detail>Hi!   I want to book a 3-day break in Germany. I can't decide between going to Berlin or going to the Rhine area. Has anyone been to both and can give their opinion? Or can you recommend some highlights of either place? I'm worried that Berlin will just be another european city or that the Rhine area may not be interesting enough for 3 days.    Thanks very much!</detail>
      <category>Travel;Germany;Other - Germany</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Well, I'd say that either is a good choice.  Depends on what you like.    Berlin is a unique city in my opinion.  If you go there, focus on the stuff that makes it unique - the history of World War II, division, reunification and the fall of the wall. All fascinating.  That means visiting things like the Reichstag, the Holocaust Memorial, the Jewish Museum, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, the Wall museum/exhibit, the Topographie of Terrors exhibit, the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedachtniskirche.  If you vis...</answer>
        <answer>If you're deciding between Berlin and Frankfurt, I'd definitely recommend Berlin. But you should also consider going to a more northern town in the Rhine valley: If you plan your break to take you to Cologne you get a great, vibrant city that also offers a lot of history. Plus, you can go on a day-trip to the Eifel (there's a recently founded natural preserve there. Or you go to the Ruhrgebiet and see how they have turned lots of industrial buildings and sites into all things cultural.</answer>
        <answer>Berlin and Rhine are great but would go for Berlin much more to do and Learn  and discover. If you are into Shopping and looking at different things Berlin is the way to go. But if you are into walking and looking at castles Rhine is the best way too go. I hope that i have help  you have a nice trip.</answer>
        <answer>Hello, when do You have 3 days, You must go to BERLIN. It's a very interessting town and there is entertainment and other people all around the day. The Rhine area is a nice part of Germany, but it is more for "older"people.</answer>
        <answer>I personally likes munich the best, better atmosphere than the other two places, and there was a lot to do.</answer>

        <answer>Genghis Khan didn't just kill on the battlefield to expand his empire. He killed thousands after the battles, people that had surrendered or been captured. He killed entire populations to put fear into other areas. The areas he conquered were also often ruled harshly by the invading Mongols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a violent man, beyond the needs of empire building.

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I believe they THINK they will be impartial. They might even criticize the color of his tie!! maybe.....</answer>
        <answer>I completely agree with you on this. ABC is an extremely biased news giant. Just as in the election debates, no tough questions will be answered, like... How he plans on paying for his Trillion dollar health-care plan without raising taxes for lower/middle class families.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  It will just be another chance for Obamagic to glorify himself, and for uninformed Americans to once again be spellbound by his so called "intelligence."</answer>
        <answer>I doubt they will present these facts...&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.</answer>
        <answer>I was going out so thanks for reminding me I will tivo a couple different ones to make sure I see only Obama not the view of the people who speak about what he said. Fox is the worst but I didn't know ABC does that. I have never really watched them before but will tivo them tonight if CNN is not having it.</answer>
        <answer>They should report on Obama's previous speeches on how he plans to create a single payer, Universal Health Care Plan. Something he denies today, but here are his words. Let's see if they report them.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/06/12/video-the-public-plan-deception/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://hotair.com/archives/2009/06/12/vi…&lt;/a&gt;</answer>

        <answer>The refugees were partly from Padua, also from Aquileia which pretty much destroyed by the Huns (in 452).  They fled there because its position in the Lagoon is defensible enough that the barbarians couldn't attack it.  It was so impregnable that it wasn't successfully attacked for the entire period of the Venetian Republic.  It only gave into the French demands of surrender because the French threatened to use cannons to level the city.</answer>

      <title>I am trying to get an 03 Eclipse GTS, how reliable are these cars?</title>
      <detail>I had a wreck a few months ago, and its about time for the insurance money to get in. I am looking at getting a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse GTS, because the 3rd Generation Eclipses are one of my favorite cars. It has an automatic transmission with 80,724 miles on it. I am 16, and I have looked up a lot about these cars. I have found a lot of consumer reviews saying that the 03s are really good cars and are fairly reliable with regular maintenance. My mom was told by two dealers that they have a lot of problems and will break down and doesn't want to listen to me about them that much.   What I want to know is, how reliable are they exactly? What are some common problems, and how much does it cost to fix approximately?   Also, the Eclipse I am looking at seems to be in very good condition, and is a one owner car listed for $7,995. I know that we can get them down to about $6k to $6.5 probably, would that be a good deal on one?</detail>

        <answer>It'll be alright. I've got the '03 GS, which has a stronger engine, but I've got experience with those motors as well. With maintenance, they can last a long time. Without, they will fall apart, quickly. In fact, I've got a 6G72 parked in front of my house right now. 150k and still runs like a top after years of abuse and neglect (not my car).

      <answers>
        <answer>If only Congress could bully them like they do our banks! Of course they lowered our credit rating.  Have you seen our debt to GDP ratio?</answer>
        <answer>That is just a matter of fact, the more debt we take on the riskier of an investment we become. The same thing applies to you, me and everybody else.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Look at your credit rating, is it a perfect credit score of 800? If not, will that prevent you from borrowing again?</answer>
        <answer>I thought Moody did that.  I am surprised it's that good.   China is angry at HOW THE U.S. is manipulating their money and  making  our  money worthless and tehrefor all the treasury bonds the Chinese hold worthless as well.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  No  it won't. I'm hoping that it would encourage Obama to stop printing money and increase the interest rate.   He won't do that, though.  If he did that people would realize how screwed up our country is.</answer>

      <title>Big-O Notation, Object-Oriented Programming, Java?</title>
      <detail>If I wanted to determine the efficiency in terms of Big-O notation for the following code, what would I be looking for:   protected void find(T target)   {     location = list;     found = false;      while (location != null)      {       if (location.getInfo().equals(target))  // if they match       {        found = true;        return;       }       else       {         previous = location;         location = location.getLink();       }     }   }  My guess is that it's O(N), but would it be O(N^2) since there's another method being called from within the while loop (location.getInfo().equals(target))? Is it true that I must increment the power of N by one every time I encounter a method call like this, even if it's a simple method which contains nothing larger than O(1) efficiency?</detail>
      <category>Computers &amp; Internet;Programming &amp; Design</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>It is O(N). .equals compares the memory address of location.getInfo() with the memory address of target, so it's like saying a = b, in which case the complexity is O(1). You must increment the power of N when you have nested loops; ex.: while in while.</answer>

      <title>Of the 3 courses (Pebble Beach, Poppy Hills and Spyglass Hill) Which is the most challenging?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Sports;Golf</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>No question. Spyglass.  Very tight fairways, very small greens. Lots of sand.    However, Pebble Beach can be very hard if the weather is bad. Most of the holes on Pebble are unprotected from the ocean and winds can get pretty strong there.    Much of Spyglass is in the trees &amp; protected.</answer>
        <answer>Spyglass Hill is most Challenging..    I went there this super becuase I won the Calloway world jounior golf tournament so it was all hard but I would say spyglass hill...</answer>
        <answer>Ive played Pebble Beach and i found it extremely challenging</answer>
        <answer>Spyglass   Spyglass Hill is rated one of the toughest courses in the world from the Championship tees, boasting a course rating of 75.5 and a slope rating of 147. The PGA Tour consistently lists Spyglass Hill's holes 6, 8 and 16 among the toughest on the tour.  i live nearby and have never played any of them, but  the local golfers agree.</answer>
        <answer>Spyglass, like the person above me said.    We play there for High School Golf tem and we shoot pretty high there even though we're state champs.</answer>

      <title>I'm coming to Denver from Baku(Azerbaijan). The airway ticket is very expensive directly to Denver.?</title>
      <detail>Is is possible to buy cheap tickets form JFK Airport(New York)?Or some advices how to get to Denver from New York?Thanks in advance</detail>
      <category>Travel;United States;Denver</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Why would you want to fly in to New York if you're going to Denver? That would be like a three day drive just to get from New York to Denver. Actually if you look to fly in to smaller towns Denver's tickets are cheap.  Have you tried online sites to get the tickets? you can find some really good deals.</answer>
        <answer>It is almost always cheaper to make stops and transfers rather than a direct flight.&lt;br&gt;  Frontier and Southwest often have good prices within the states, but first check with whatever airlines you're flying with from Baku.  Usually there should be somewhere to check that says number of stops while you're searching travel dates with prices.</answer>
        <answer>Try www.amtrak.com for information about train service from New York to Denver.  The trip should take about 3 days and nights.  Or, look at www.greyhound.com for information about bus travel.</answer>

You will have to get with the Sudanese embassy. I don't remember if there is one in Accra so you may have to call them and see where to go to get ahold of one. There will be a way to get a visa in any country that has flights to it so try there.  Good luck and be safe there.</answer>

I used to like James Patterson but after having read most of them, I'm starting to find that (with the exception of the ones about the children with wings) they are a bit formulaic.  Also, the characters, especially the villains, are a bit one-dimentional and without depth.  Villains that are pure evil can be fun, but they're all the same --...</answer>
        <answer>For the murder/mystery aspect you could try John Sanford. I love his books. They have a main detective Lucas Davenport, just like James Patterson has Alex Cross.

        <answer>Actually, two  of the fatalities at Kent State were women. Thee never was an incident involving an all girls college. And watch your apostrophe when you spell girls'. (Or girls's, depending on which style manual you use.)</answer>
        <answer>One of the kids shot at Kent State was female. I thinks some of the wounded students were to. That is the only case that I know of where "some girl's" were shot.</answer>

The following still applies:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Rarely do they go into combat. Every Marine Division has a staff of JAG officers.

        <answer>As a JAG officer, you will most likely never go to the Middle East. But if you did, your job would be relatively safe. They don't send lawyers on combat patrols, you know what I mean? I can't sit here and tell there was never a JAG officer who had ever died, but if there have been, you could probably count the number on one hand.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  There work consists of basic lawyer stuff. Except everything is in military style I guess you could say. Represent Marines who get in trouble.</answer>

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Military</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>soon there wont be any point in NATO existing because of Eurocorps, once the European union has a more centralized military. It was to counter russia after WW2, but as the majority members of nato are part of the European union (not number of troops) including the 53 commonwealth states NATO will lose to many members to continue functioning propally and the USA would simply just have there own single military body again.</answer>
        <answer>NATO makes any attack on a western country suicidal thats a good enough reason for it to be kept in my opinion. The United Kingdom would choose the defence of NATO over the EU for certain.</answer>

It is not like a watch, but simply to provide more information.  The short term forecast is typically a forecast that provides more detailed weather information in the short term, a period of the next few hours or so.</answer>

The NSA program reaches into homes and businesses across the nation by amassing information about the calls of ordinary Americans  most of whom aren't suspected of any crime. This program does not involve the NSA listening to or recording conversations. But the spy agency is using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity, sources said in separate interviews.

      <title>Sugar free amp during atkins induction?!!?</title>
      <detail>I just started the atkins diet today so I'm currently in the induction period.       i've done this diet before a while back and have gotten great results (most of my issue is toning which I'm also working on by doing pilates w/a ball 3 times a week along with cardio workout twice a week). I only want to lose about 8 lbs (since i'm 5"1 and 105)      this time around, I've cut out all diet soda and crystal light-basically anything w/aspartame in it. it gives me horrible migraines and i've heard it can also cause stalling.       i've become quite attached to the new sugar free amp energy drink made by mountain dew. I LOVED diet mountain dew prior to cutting out the soda so this drink is perfect. I only drink them when I'm at work (3 nights a week for 12 hours) and it's only 1 per night. I looked at the can and their is no sugar, no aspartame, and only 75mg sodium per serving (2 servings per can).       I try googling to see if it was safe for induction but can't find it posted anywhere. I assume it's ok since I'm allowed to use splenda which is an aspartame free sweetener.       anybody know if this stuff is ok? if not, I guess I'll have to suck it up and get used to drinking my ice tea and water only...      thanks in advance  :)</detail>

      <title>Apart from their hit status, what do Marianne Faithfull, Dusty Springfield and Rod Stewart have in common?</title>
      <detail>Marianne Faithfull was born December 29 1946.    Dusty Springfield was born April 16 1939; she died on March 2 1999 and her funeral took place on March 12 1999.  Her ashes were scattered into the sea, off the west Irish coastline.    Rod Stewart was born on January 10 1945.      It took Rod seven years to get his debut hit single {in 1971 with a double-'a'-sided "Maggie May"/"Reason To Believe"}.  Rod's very first single was with "Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl", in 1964.  At this stage he was signed to Decca Records.    Dusty was a member of the Lana Sisters in the late 50s, before becoming a third of the Springfields, who formed in 1960.  Their debut hit {albeit a minor one} was with "Breakaway".  Following two Top 5 hits with "Island Of Dreams", then with "Say I Won't Be There", both in 1963, their follow-up single {"Come On Home"} is a hit, but only as far as  31.  At this stage the Springfields broke up and Dusty went solo.  Tom Springfield produced the Seekers.</detail>

Oprah discussed a quote by the CDC, which for the first time, they admit they simply do not know and they are currently researching possible links between autism and vaccines.      Question:  does this new information change your views of vaccines?  Will you question giving your children vaccines?  Have you done any research prior to giving your child vaccines?</detail>

        <answer>As a mother of a 16 year old autistic son, until they can tell me what DOES cause autism everything is suspect in my mind.    We did not follow the recommended shot guideline  with our younger children, going more with a delayed plan of our own from the Stephanie Cave logic.  If they had so much as a runny nose they didn't get the shot until they were healthy.  No immune issues at the time of any shot.      I never used drugs, I did all the right things in the pregnancy and before it, just like ...</answer>
        <answer>I am a bit worried, but I still will get my daughter all her vaccines.  I haven't done much research on the matter but I did work in Special Education before I became a mom.  I know that many more children are getting tested for autism than before.  There have always been obvious cases of autism, but with higher public awareness they are testing kids that I doubt would have been test 10 or 20 years ago.</answer>
        <answer>***sorry this is so long-winded lol***    If you go to Opera's website http://www2.oprah.com/tows/slide/200709/...

This commitment not only stems from our scientific and medical dedication, it is also personalfor most of us who work at CDC are also parents and grandparents. And as suc...</answer>

His advise was to go ahead with it, that if it were true there would be several more cases than there are.   His baby is one week younger than mine and his will be doing all vaccines. I feel as if it is good enough for pediatrician's child, then it is good enough for mine. He is the one who went med school and understand...</answer>
        <answer>I just asked a similar question. I am now researching the vaccinations my son will get more thoroughly because I have a right to know what is going to enter his body. Before, I hardly questioned it because I thought it was the best for him.    The link between the mercury and autism isn't easily determined because there are many environmental factors that we should consider as well.

      <title>Why does the AAP (i don't want to use 20 characters)?</title>
      <detail>only recommend one year of breast feeding, where as the WHO recommends two years. I mean, it doesn't make sense. So the ONLY country in the world to recommend one year is the United States, basically? I just want to make sure I have this right or are there other organization beyond that?</detail>
      <category>Pregnancy &amp; Parenting;Newborn &amp; Baby</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Well I suspect there's a variety of factors involved.  One probably has to do with the wealth and general health of the countries involved.  For example, in a poor country where people frequently don't get enough protein or vegetables or the water supply is compromised, extended breastfeeding is probably the best choice for an infant.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Also, AAP recommendations seem to be REALLY behind the rest of the world.  I bet there's a fair amount of politics and bureaucracy  involved.  I mean, t...</answer>
        <answer>Well, this is from the WHO website:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;   Breastmilk is the natural first food for babies, it provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child’s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one-third during the second year of life.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Breastmilk promotes sensory and cognitive development, and protects the infant against infectious and chronic diseases. Exclusi...</answer>
        <answer>The AAP doesn't want to go out on a limb and offend anybody.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  It is like the formula companies putting "breast is best" on their bottles but then advertising and advocating that you buy their formula anyways.  (Yea - we covered our butts with the "breast is best" but we don't really want anyone to go that route.)&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Also in other countries - its mommy's milk or water.  The 2nd and 3rd world countries don't have access to milk, formula, and other healthy options, so giving up nu...</answer>
        <answer>The answers you've already gotten are good, I'll just add my own two cents. It seems to me to be a culture thing also. Most people in this country do not even breastfeed for that one year, so they are trying to get people to breastfeed for at least that long. People tend to look at you weird here if you continue breastfeeding past the age of one, which I find completely rediculous! A one year old is still a baby in my opinion and they don't know that they've hit that reccomended one year mark. B...</answer>
        <answer>I don't take heed to many recommendations from the AAP. For an organization that is so concerned about the "health and welfare" of it's children it sure does struggle to stay in the top forty for childhood mortality. I suppose this would be different if our health care system was based upon our doctors being poor instead of being some of the highest paid "professionals" in the industry.</answer>

      <title>What was the significance of the siege of Leningrad?</title>
      <detail>I have a project and i can't seem to find this one thing can someone help me please?</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The significance of the Siege of Leningrad lies in the tragic and heroic plight of the citizens of the Russian city during World War 2. The siege(or Blokaka) lasted 900 days (from Sept. 8, 1941 until Jan. 27, 1944). An estimated 200,000 people died from cold or starvation, and despite this the city never surrendered to the Germans.</answer>
        <answer>It was the point where the Soviets turned the war in their favor by sitting through the winter while the Germans froze to death.</answer>
        <answer>That Leningrad was never taken!  The Wehrmacht diverted a lot of forces and manpower to take the city, and it became more than a sore spot behind the German army's advance towards Moscow.  It also gave the Soviet citizens hope, because Leningrad was holding.    Of course, thousands of citizens died from the cold, malnutrition, hunger, disease, illness, etc.  It wasn't pretty, but it was the only bright spot during the German invasion in 1942.</answer>
        <answer>epic defense for a thousand days cost the lives of more than a million civilians. let you know if i find more</answer>
        <answer>If you can tell me what perspective of the war you are looking from I could probably help. Is your perspective from the german point of view? Russian? The effect it had on the war in general? Historical significance. You can email if you want.</answer>

        <answer>Your point to this rambling is? Are you arguing for the creative expression people feel granted by substances? Or perhaps you choose to argue that the greatest minds are molded by "drugs".    Here's what I will say: drugs are indeed a way to enhance a vision or message. I completely agree with one's right to the use of any of the sort (as long as the rights of others are not infringed upon).

      <category>Travel;Africa &amp; Middle East;Bahrain</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>BD 1000 per month is enough for a family and also for saving. As long as transportation &amp; accommodation is taken care of, you are in a good state. Other things like food and clothing is cheap. You can have a meal for you and your family for no more than BD 3. Clothes can be also cheap. Fuel is cheap, it is 100 Fils ($ 0.26) per liter.    There are twho very well reputed Indian Schools in Bahrain. The Indian School of Bahrain is one of the best. Do not worry, your offer is very good. Go ahead.</answer>
        <answer>Well it actually depends on your lifestyle but on the average, your  salary is more than enough. Since transportation and accommodation is already provided, that BD1000 is all for your savings. Let say you spend around BD100 for monthly groceries, BD40 for petrol, and BD100 for your personal entertainment stuff (i believe all work and no play makes a man dull - it's for eating out, watching movies, etc). You have enough to send back home and to save a little in case of emergencies.</answer>
        <answer>As they exchange rates are improved you can save that much. As iam in the same package. iam saving that much</answer>

      <category>Entertainment &amp; Music;Television;Other - Television</category>

        <answer>This is a HUGE problem with Fox, they are consistently cancelling amazing shows (although Fastlane wasn't that good to be honest), without giving them a chance to prove themselves.    Remember this when the fall season starts, you take a big risk watching Fox's new shows. Why they just can't transfer them over to the FX channel I will never know.</answer>
        <answer>Yeah, and its like a disease that is spreading. ABC is getting the same way, cancelling a great show like What About Brian, and putting on a show about Cavemen. These networks don't seem to care about what we the viewers want to see anymore. I miss those days.

        <answer>It's not so much the stickiness as the spreading of the cookies when baking--peanut butter will probably spread the least, but it's messy to roll out and cut, hard to handle without messing up the shapes.  Oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies spread out so much you'll lose the shape.  You can frost the regular round shapes they naturally make though, once cool they are ok for frosting.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Shortbread and most refrigerator  butter cookie recipes work for rolling out and cutting.  It needs so...</answer>
        <answer>I'm thinking you might want to consider a ganache to use as a dipping frosting or spread.  I dip oatmeal raisins half in white chocolate ganache and drizzle with a thin dark chocolate ganache.&lt;br&gt;  You can also make classic molasses ginger cookies and frost them with a cream cheese frosting that has a little lemon zest in it.</answer>

      <title>How come the AAP condones breastfeeding until 2 years of age for breastfed babies?</title>
      <detail>But not formula feeding until 2 years of age for formula fed babies?</detail>
      <category>Pregnancy &amp; Parenting;Newborn &amp; Baby</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>because breast milk changes on a daily basis for years as your child's needs change. if your baby is sick it becomes more watery and helps with dehydration (a big reason i HATE when docs discourage BFing a sick baby, they are doing a huge dis-service to those babies). &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  if your baby has diarrhea, breast milk thickens to help prevent runny stools. our bodies are amazing. &lt;br&gt;  formula has no real nutritional value after the age of 1. which is why moms are told to feed vitamin D milk aft...</answer>
        <answer>beacuse there are no benefits of formula after a year if your child is eating a well balanced diet. However, there are countless for breastfeeding. it has antibodies  it chances with the child's needs, ia lso reduces both mother and child's risk for cancer. it reduces the mother' risk for breast cancer a lot.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  WHAT! is up with all these thumbs down? some people are seriously crazy.</answer>
        <answer>The nutritional value of breast milk is tailored to where the child is developmentally. The milk a 6 moth old drinks and an 18 month old drinks is different. Formula is static. By the time a child is one, they need different amounts of fats, vitamins, carbs and so on which they will find in table foods.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  wow check out the TD fairy lol</answer>
        <answer>What is with the TD's for all of this?  Nobody is putting down formula!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Breastmilk does change, formula does not (other than the next step stuff) to adjust to baby's needs.  That is fact.</answer>
        <answer>Because that's how perfect a food breast milk is, and formula is not.  Whole food is better for a baby once their digestive system can handle it (compared to formula) but breast milk is still better .  Probably mainly because it contains anti-bodies that can protect the baby from illness; formula can't do that.  There's only one problem with breastfeeding a baby until 2 years old.......getting them to stop wanting it before they turn three!</answer>

Confusing right? my question is can you refig baking soda if that makes it more clear..</detail>
      <category>Food &amp; Drink;Cooking &amp; Recipes</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Yep! Great idea, I do that all the time!</answer>
        <answer>I've made sugar - and other kinds of cookies, lots of time, often refrigerated them for a day or even two, with no problems what so ever. Just mix all the ingredients together, form the dough into a round disc, wrap in plastic wrap (if you have onions or any other strong smells in your fridge, I would double wrap or put the dough in a sealed plastic bag) and let chill over night. If you want to cut the dough into shapes or something, that will be much easier after it is chilled.</answer>
        <answer>Whenever I make cookies I always refrigerate the batter for at least an hour-its fine if you leave it overnight too. It makes them rise more and also makes them more fluffy. I also use baking powder in them, so dont worry about it. You CAN refrigerate baking soda and have no problems.</answer>
        <answer>Sure--no problem.  I form mine into a roll the diameter of the size cookie I want, then wrap in plastic wrap.  That way I can just slice the cookies and bake rather than all the mess of rolling the dough. You can use dental floss (unflavored) to cut--just wrap around and pull.  Remember that as the dough is cold it might take a little extra time to bake.</answer>
        <answer>Yes. In fact some recipes say to refrigerate over night. And of course, you can refirgerate baking soda, too. Heck, you can buy a box of it, just for the refrigerator.</answer>

        <answer>Congress of Vienna met to discuss problems created by Napoleon. They ensured that Europe and France were safe from him by exiling him first to Elba and then to St Helena. They were more concerned about restoring Bourbon rule in France. They followed a policy of punishing those who supported Napoleon and rewarding those who stood together in bringing about his fall.

        <answer>It's professors choice, often their own book!    Each professor has his own syllubus and text book.</answer>
        <answer>It is probably the same text books as every other university uses, except those professors would have rewrote the same concepts and would charge 3 times more for the material only available in their bookstore. Physics is physics no matter what book it is from. Just look it up in your library.</answer>

        <answer>Yes, they do. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Look for the Advantix name.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=aps+film" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?u…&lt;/a&gt;</answer>
        <answer>Yes they do.  I just saw APS film in a grocery store a few days ago, in fact.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Although, to be honest, I never used APS (even though I use almost entirely film for all my pictures).  I don't like APS because it's just too awkward and I don't like how automated APS cameras are.  Advantix never really caught on.  If I'm going to use a smaller format film, I prefer regular 35mm film.  Heck, I think I even prefer 110 film cartridges better than APS.</answer>

      <title>Do you think AAP will endorse circumcision for all baby boys this October?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Pregnancy &amp; Parenting;Newborn &amp; Baby</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>They never will, because there is no medical or health reason or benefit from the procedure except to line to pockets of greedy American doctors.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  What you need to know about circumcision is that is it a terrible mutilation of the human body. No civilised person could ever allow this to happen to someone they claim to love. Circumcision is the removal of the (male) foreskin. Uncut or uncircumcised refer to the natural state of the penis where the whole of the sexual organs are intact. ...</answer>
        <answer>I have sent correspondence to some of the members on&lt;br&gt;  the AAP Task Force showing them the many reasons&lt;br&gt;  why the foreskin is important to both the man and his&lt;br&gt;  female sexual partner.  They appear to be getting the&lt;br&gt;  message that&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Infant Circumcision Harms Adult Sexuality&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://ForeskinFunctions.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://ForeskinFunctions.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://xrl.us/BigBangSex" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://xrl.us/BigBangSex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;  .</answer>
        <answer>They better not, at least NOT until they have investigated what occurs when a babies sensory system is changed by removing 20000 fine touch and stretch nerve endings and disconnecting a huge natural input to the brain.  If they don't even consider that, and they somehow recommend rem,oval of erogenous tissue from male infants, it becomes clear that they are simply trying to keep the practice going for there own reasons.  What those reasons are, I don't know.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  This surgery takes away ma...</answer>
        <answer>I doubt it, although it wouldn't be the first time. The AAP's position is influenced by pressure from its members. Keeping your child intact is the norm in the USA now. There is a bit about the rise and fall of circumcision rates here, with some of the various medical reasons given for it here: &lt;a href="http://www.veoh.com/collection/Circumcis…" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.veoh.com/collection/Circumcis…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  No medical research has been able to conclusively support routine circumcision o...</answer>

      <category>Health;Diet &amp; Fitness</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>When choosing an Omega 3 fish oil supplement I think its important to look for one that uses only high-quality formulas that are mercury-free. One thing I've learned to look for in the research I've been doing over the past few years is to make sure the supplement you take has high levels of DHA and EPA Omega-3s for the best prevention of all the possible diseases that could be caused from deficiencies. Anyway I use one called Arctic Essentials because it has 1600 total Omega 3's and it comes fr...</answer>
        <answer>As far as I know, fish from the Arctic ocean are a great source of Omega 3 fatty acids, it is just important to make sure the oils are processed in a clean, high quality facility. I read some good reviews on Arctic Essentials and that's the supplement I take. I like it because it does not smell or taste fishy like some of the others I've used before. It's the best I've found.</answer>
        <answer>Everyone was talking about fish oils and I really didn't know what was best at first. I went to the store to bye one and saw a bunch of different types and felt pretty overwhelmed. I went online to do more research - I didn't want to just waste money on something that wouldn't do much for me- and lots &amp; lots of people gave Arctic Essentials a high rating. I've been feeling more focused since taking it, I have to say. I'd try that, if u need a good one!</answer>

      <detail>He is such a cutie and so talented.  I can't believe they would force him to resign because he lied about things having NOTHING to do with becoming a Food Network star.  Please--ok--yes he lied, but does anyone else think he was a felon or something and they booted him off and made it just look like he resigned?</detail>

        <answer>Amy and Rory probably lied about themselves too.    I don't like this season show. I like the last season when nobody cried....  Guy was the best thing.    Jag should have won if he didn't resign.    If I ever see him again, I'll ask him to cook for me.</answer>
        <answer>First of all, he resigned, they did not force him. And, he should not have lied to begin with. When you go into the public eye like those people they should know that news people are going to be after a story. Don't know how his came out, but in the end it did and it cost him. He was not cut out for the Food Network yet. He had a temper problem and was all over the place. I really hope Amy gets it as she is very genuine and someone I can see myself watching on the Food Network.</answer>
        <answer>Oh, my god, please tell me you're kidding.    That puss lied about his military service!  He of the gold jewelry and greased backed hair (talk about an unmanly man) I never saw him as a tough Marine and was not surprised he got his butt thrown off.  He has problems and that was obvious the first show.    My 23 year old daughter has served two tours this war, once right smack dab in the middle of Iraq as a convoy gunner.  My 18 year old son joined the Army Reserves at 17, did boot camp the summer...</answer>
        <answer>dont listen to them! he was also my fav out of all of them! and he would have won too! but i voted for amy</answer>
        <answer>I was rooting for Jag, it's true that he shouldn't have lied, but they shouldn't have booted him for it b/c I agree that it has nothing to do with becoming the Next Food Network Star. They should have stuck to judging him for his skills. Besides, they got way too many girls with cooking shows. They need more guys on the Food Network Channel, new guys, new races, quit hiring girls who are Italian, it's starting to get boring! like that slutty Giada, I do not like her, she's always BS'ing about he...</answer>

      <title>Do u think Carthage could avoid going to war with Rome and why not?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>No, impossible. Carthage was the residing power, mainly economically. Rome was the coming power, mainly military. A clash was inevitable.</answer>
        <answer>As Wanderer said Carthage was the major trade power of the med and had almost complete control of it, Rome however was expanding at an exponential rate thus it was inevitable that the two would clash. Additionally Romes vindictive demands and treatment of Carthage prior to the second and third punic wars were obvious attempts to goad Carthage into another fight which they got and in the case of the second were nearly overrun for their troubles.</answer>
        <answer>No. The two major powers in the Mediterranean prior to the first century BC were Carthage and Rome. Both wanted to control trade between the Eastern and Western Mediterranean, which Carthage originally had while they controlled the island of Sicily. Neither power could fully control the trade route while the other existed, however, and this is ultimately what Rome determined going into the Third Punic War, choosing to utterly destroy Carthage, including the salting of Carthaginian fields so that...</answer>
        <answer>Well back then, Rome wanted Sicily which Carthage had.  So that's why they had 3 Punic Wars and no I don't think Carthage could avoid going to war with Rome.</answer>

      <category>Business &amp; Finance;Investing</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>There ain't no "about" time for it.  It is precisely at 9:30 AM and the close is at precisely 4:00 PM.  Of course there is really no closing with the after hours market and the pre-market.  Trades will generally cost you more for the special service to make trades at those times.</answer>
        <answer>The stock market regularly trades from 930A-400P Eastern time Mon-Fri.     But there is separate after hours trading before and after as well.    So for example, today, Yahoo closed at 24.15, but the aftermarket bid/ask ended at 6pm ET at 24.80 by 24.83.      Hope that helps!</answer>

        <answer>Certification is always in your favor, plus needed skills and experience.  Lockheed will probably do drug testing. US citizenship could be required, also the ability to get a security clearance so, no expensive speeding tickets, felony convictions, history of drug use etc...  Check out the website - there are lots of locations. Pick one nearest you and look through the career opportunities.  Find out the name of a recruiter inside and contact that person, ask around to find an inside contact.   ...</answer>
        <answer>Maybe before you correct someone's grammar, you could make sure that your correction is actually correct.  Then, consider the fact that an MBA is a business degree, and therefore not related to Computer Science degrees.    Go with amelia's advice.</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>Supposedly, yes, sucralose is ok. But then again it hasn't been around as long as aspartame, which took a while to reveal its ugly side effects. (My personal favorites are that it can wear the lining of your digestive tract, and become a virtual magnet for fatty deposits in the body. So much for diet soda)&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I vote natural sugar or none at all.</answer>
        <answer>It is safe as approved by the FDA, but I think it gives liquids a weird texture. I stopped drinking Diet 7-Up because of it. Hello Sprite Zero!</answer>
        <answer>the government approved its use, but no synthetic sweeteners are 100% organic.  I use it sometimes.</answer>

        <answer>Definately wearing winter clothes in the Sahara desert. You can take clothes off. But in Antartica... if you're naked you'll get frostbite and hypothermia in like 10 minutes. &lt;br&gt;I have been to the Sahara desert, and actually, covering up is good because it stops you getting sunburnt. You're fine there as long as you have food and water. It's quite hot during the day, but it does get really cold at night, so you actually have to change into warmer clothing after 8pm.</answer>
        <answer>I love being naked when its warm so I would prefer wearing winter clothes in the Sahara because I could always take them off at night and wear less layers during the day and keep my skin protected. Being naked in Antarctica would give me no such options and I would die very quickly.</answer>

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Entertainment &amp; Music;Music;Country</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Taylor will be performing in Lafayette, Louisiana on September 10th, her official site does not say when the tickets will be going on sale. That's probably because September is a long time from now and they don't want to start selling tickets so early. But check back at the beginning of June, you might see something about when they're going on sale then.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Check back here in May/June, bookmark the page or something.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://taylorswift.com/tourpage.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http...</answer>

      <title>Aren't nervous for tomorrow guys?!? Germany vs Holland?</title>
      <detail>I am so nervous. Germany has to win... Ozil.. Klose.. Is anyone else nervous?!?</detail>
      <category>Sports;Football (Soccer);English Football (Soccer)</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Holland should be the more nervous team than Germany, considering they just played their easiest game and lost to them.  I wouldn't be surprised if Holland comes out with extreme nerves and lays an egg against Germany.  I predicted 2-2 originally, but that was before they lost to Denmark.  Germany has total control, and should realize that a point will probably put them into the next round</answer>
        <answer>It's one of those great Footballs 'darby's' I think it will be close and I wouldn't be surprised if either team win. They've both got so much quality but Germany edges it for me over the world cup finalists. &lt;br&gt;Germany are a maturing side, they are a brilliant team.</answer>
        <answer>Finally a game that will keep my eyes open, a Champions League quality encounter or else they will be almost statute-like fixed on my laptop with the odd break of concentration from raised voices from the television as my nostrils are keeping me more occupied.</answer>
        <answer>I'm not nervous but it will be a good game. 2-1 to Germany. Ozil and Muller for Germany. Arjen Robben for The Netherlands</answer>
        <answer>Germany are the best team at Euro 2012 and I think they'll knock Holland out tonight , ignore Lee he's obviously a homo!!!!!</answer>

      <title>How do you view the desertion of the Congress Party by Laloo in the critical pre Election period?</title>
      <detail>Laloo has so far been enjoying immunity from his WELLMERITED DOOM  through his unholy proximity with the Congress Party. After his initiaL 5 stints in Prison, he has been making merry , hoping to go scotfree from the just deserts  of his universally known sins. When the UPA ship appears to sink due to desertions by allies, this greatest beneficiary of Soniaji's bounty has ditched her.   Not that she is any better, having welcomed Laloo's bete noires, Sadhu Yadav &amp; Ramai Ram  in her fold. What pattern do you think will emerge after  this Kaleidoscopic    exchanges  between these now  hostile camps ?</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Elections</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>First, Laloo did not actually desert the UPA. He overestimated his importance in the national political scene and his necessity to the UPA and to the Congress Party. So he nominated RJD candidates from the majority of the Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, leaving a bare handful for the Congress. &lt;br&gt;  Not that Laoo is totally wrong. The main political forces in Bihar centre around Laloo and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The Congress is just a signboard there. Contesting seats from Bihar would be meaningl...</answer>
        <answer>Laloo got what he wanted with the handful of his MPs.He knew all the time that to get into central scene was to tag on to the low down Congress.BJP would not even touch him with a barge pole. In spite of Laloo calling her names Sonia had to be humiliated and get along with him because she had to have the power so...Laloo and Sonia deserve each other?Amusing.Why not if they can do it once again all over I mean form a govt. Everything is right here forget modesty.morality,ethics and civil courtesi...</answer>
        <answer>congress wants to destroy regional parties..lalu was the best minister in the upa government ,he deserves better..the congress does not have a hold in the cowbelts.they only deserved 3 seats in bihar ..they could not have given more seat to the congress to lose it..after the election sonia will know lalu's worth..mark my words sonia will be on lalu's feet begging him to support the congress.</answer>
        <answer>he will come back and shake hands with congress after the elections are over, provided the congress bags more than 190 seats</answer>

        <answer>ok, im not sure if you will consider this cutting your hair, but there is this type of comb that has a razor in it it so it makes your hair a lot fluffier with more layers. also, dying it black or some pretty color would make it more scene/emo. also, if you tease it and/or spike it up it will help A LOT. Good Luck!</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>No, I merely thought it was remarkable.  I think it's especially surprising that it's such a neatly circular hole with fairly smooth sides--it almost looks man-made.  Weird things happen sometimes, and this is one of those times.  We know what the causes of the sinkhole are, so there's no great mystery about it.</answer>
        <answer>sing holes happen all the time</answer>
        <answer>I live in Florida. There are sinkholes all over this state. Every time one opens up, the world doesn't end. This has been happening for literally millions of years, in fact, I have dug up two-million-year-old fossils of tapirs and giant sloths from the clay that once filled an ancient sinkhole.</answer>
        <answer>No.  It is just another hole in Guatemala.  And you are an idiot.</answer>

        <answer>It's ok, but highly unrealistic.  Ryan Gosling's character is completely out of his mind.  I'd love to see a version of The Notebook in which Dr. Gregory House and his team diagnose and cure whatever brain tumor or neurological disease is affecting him, preferably right after he bangs Rachel McAdams for the first time.  Let's see if he still sticks around after that.</answer>
        <answer>No, that movie was a crime against humanity.  As penance, Ryan Gosling had to consort with RealDolls, which is how he met his true love, Bianca.</answer>

        <answer>The KGB was the umbrella organization name for the Soviet Union's premier security, secret police, and intelligence agency, from 1954 to 1991 they do what our CIA does now did then and will forever do they,  kill people, provide arms for  coups so that they can install puppet regimes, distribute propaganda and spy on their own citizens and they also can  erase you, which means not KILL you though they do that they will just non-exist you</answer>
        <answer>They do (did) exactly the same thing the CIA/FBI do combined. It is called something else now but under the USSR the KGB was a tough cookie. Putin was pretty high ranking official in the old KGB.   Hope this helps you.</answer>

However that was pre 9/11 and they've likely increased security--making advanced reservations is probably a good idea.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Also fwiw the tour wasn't all that interesting--you're basically just wandering through a large office building.</answer>

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Science &amp; Mathematics;Geography</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>If the Stalin you refer to is the crazed russian communist dictator, basically: All religions were pretty much banned, the communist state was avowedly atheist, so I really doubt he'd patronize religious education.</answer>
        <answer>The meaning of the question is presently far from clear.  Back when Stalin was in power, Saint Petersburg was named Leningrad, and religious education wasn't illegal.  The Russian Orthodox Church accommodated itself with the political system.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Then again, you might be attempting to ask about Stalin's religious education.  He lived in what's now Georgia, and attended a seminary in Tiflis.  Apparently, that was run by the Greek Orthodox Church.</answer>

      <detail>  A democracy is a system whereby the consent of the people decides the ruling government.....How can a country which has had the same party for 98% of the time be considered to a democracy?    In a democracy, there is free speech for the people to express themselves - In India whoever criticises Islam gets a fatwa or whoever criticises Gandhi gets beatings.    In a democracy there is a free press that is independent of the goverment and imparts free and fair and unbias news reports - In India the press is extremely bias and is always favours the Congress party and communists and marxists and always unjustly criticises the BJP. In part this is due to the fact that the Indian media is run by psuedo seculars who are anti-Hindu as well as the fact that it is funded by Christian organisations.    In a democracy there is no limits to education - whereas in India the Congress party deliberatly keep the populace illiterate in order to stay in power...Moreover Hindu educational institutions are not permitted whereas Christian schools are allowed as are Islamic madrasas that preach extremism.....</detail>

      <title>Liberal Atheists, how do you like it that you are supporting Bill Gaither's Ministry?</title>
      <detail>Flipping through the dial, I noticed on two different PBS stations, Bill Gaither, the evangelical southern gospel songwriter and producer is being featured.  Checking the listings, it appears he's on several times on both my local PBS channels from Friday night through Sunday night.  I know that liberals got their knickers in a wad when it was suggested that offensive art not receive public backing when there was serious talk of defunding the National Endowment for the Arts which cut a check for artwork that many felt was objectional and offensive.  So do you support this artform as one of several various artforms that is showcased by PBS.  (Sunday night at 9 you can watch Bill Gaither at the Grand Ole Opry and then Monday night at 9, tune in to see a Wagner Opera at the Metropolitan Opera.)   Although I am an evangelical Christian, and I enjoy the message and the ministry of Bill Gaither (and Bill Gaither is on the record, on PBS as saying he sees himself as both a minister and and musician), and I have attended Gaither concerts in person and have over 12 of his videos, I am also a Libertarian and opposed to the PBS on general terms.  As I object to my tax money supporting the Piss Christ photograph, so too do I object to non-believers having their money taken from them to give to Bill Gaither et al. to fund the message that "Because He lives, I can face tomorrow...."

      <detail>With the news that Jade Goody's two sons will be sent to Australia to avoid the sadness of their mother's funeral, what impact will this action have on their capacity to grieve and will they regret not attending the funeral ?</detail>
      <category>News &amp; Events;Media &amp; Journalism</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Possibly, but not as much they would have been scarred if they did go.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  They are 4 and 6 aren't they?  Way too young to need to be there, it more than likely wont impact on them at all, it's not like they are old enough to understand and when they are if it is put to them that it was their mothers wish and in their best interest, if they are level headed individuals they should understand.</answer>
        <answer>Its a tricky one, they are both very young, I personally don't think a funeral is the place for a child.  Maybe in a few months time the family could arrange a Jade Celebration of Life Day which the boys could attend, it could be a celebration of her life rather than a mourning of her death and it would give the boys a chance to remember their mum in a positive light.</answer>
        <answer>It's sad that they won't be attending the Funeral to say goodbye to there Mum ;(,...but i'm sure Jeff Brazier; there Dad, and the rest of the family are thinking of them Mentally cause they are reported to be very very upset.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Which goes without saying.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I think it would turn into a Media Circus if they were there,..so maybe it is best that they are not.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  They can turn up later on with there Dad and the rest of the family and say there goodbyes then.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I th...</answer>
        <answer>Usually it would be a good idea to let kids say goodbye to their mother.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  But let's face facts. This thing is going to be a media circus...and it owuld be a worse media circus of the jackals thought they could get a money shot of w weeping, bereaved child.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I think the best thing we can all do for those poor little kids now is shut up about them and let what is left of their family alone to grieve.</answer>
        <answer>I agree, the funeral is an essential part of the greiving process. however i don't think with all the media attention etc that it would be a beneficial experience for two such young boys. They would hardly be able to say goodbye properly surrounded by hundreds of people and cameras.</answer>

        <answer>Eighteen is universal throughout the United States as the age at which is a person is legally considered an adult. While you're still bound by legal, behavioral limitations, 18 is the age when you are no longer a minor. A minor is someone who's younger than 18; an adult, by federal law, is someone who is 18 years of age or older. Until you become an "adult" (i.e., person at least 18), you're legally considered part of your parents.Even if you can't drink until you're 21, 18 is the age when Ameri...</answer>
        <answer>In most if not all states, you are an adult at 21.  You can actually do certain adult things at 14 such as enter into contracts for necessary food and clothing.

      <detail>I have heard many ways to accomplish this task.  There was a wild idea that they could litterally knock Mars into Earth's orbit around the sun... which seems impossible to me.  Then I have heard of filtering Earth's atmosphere of harmful greenhouse gases and bringing them to Mars... on Mars they would actually be helpful in warming the planet.  After the planet warms and the water melts they want to add a genetically engineered algae to the oceans.  This algae is said to be able to produce up to 1/2 of the required oxygen on the planet for mankind to flourish.

      <title>Need help with generics in Java - return type of methods?</title>
      <detail>I have been working on-again, off-again on a personal project called JCalculator. It's task is to parse any math equation and solve it, using priority of operations, parentheses and so on. I have hit a hurdle here:      I have decided to first parse the equation into "Token" s. Token is the superclass of all possible things to be found in a math equation - be it Function, Constant, Value, Operator, Parenthese or what not. To make calculations I want the subclasses of Value but also Constant (since even though Constants are letters and Greek symbols, they nevertheless have values) to possess a method getValue() . To this end I made an interface called AbstractValue to be implemented by both Constant and Value which is supposed to possess this getValue method. The problem is that I don't know of any way to delay the choice of return type - the return type will be specified in the subinterfaces of AbstractValue, like AbstractDouble or AbstractInt. In these subinterfaces, implemented in DoubleValue and IntegerValue respectively, the return type can be narrowed down from        getValue()      to      double getValue() or   int getValue() or   BigInteger getValue() or   BigDecimal getValue()      for example. But I don't know what to write in interface AbstractValue - how do you declare an abstract getValue() method that can return any primitive or object type from a list, and where it is the responsibility of the subinterfaces and implementing classes to pick one?      Thank you a lot!      For more details and the (very incomplete, barely started) source code, my email is obilaniu@yahoo.com</detail>

        <answer>I can't begin to explain this to you, but you will need the O'Reilly book, 'Generics'. the interfaces really will let you get away with murder, but there has to be a relationship of subclassing. You can wildcard &lt;Number&gt; to accept int, double, long, short. Add enums on top of generics and it's incredible.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Use String.split( RegEx ); Tokens makes you sound like a groovy pad, like wow, like laid back, man.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  To read that O'Reilly book takes me a week to read 15 pages.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; ...</answer>

        <answer>Just check the price of getting to Kiev. I have no idea where you will be travelling from so I can't possibly tell you the price. But anyway the price of airplane tickets to Kiev will make up the largest part of your expenses. When you are here, you'll spend 5-20 usd to get to Kiev (from the airport), several usd to get to the bus station, 1-20 usd to reach you final destination in Kiev Oblast (depending on how far away from Kiev it is located).</answer>
        <answer>One way ticket will very in price depending on where you are coming from and how early or late you buy your ticket.

Other places (2-3 days available) The Alamo, TX Guadalupe Mountains National Park, TX New Orleans, LA  Joshua Tree is on the way so I'll be stopping there too. Are any of these places sort of let downs?

        <answer>&gt;&gt;Speak English, not Latin    That is a misconception. Vatican II actually stated that while "the limits of its [the mother tongue] employment may be extended", "the use of the Latin language is to be PRESERVED in the Latin rites" (SC 36, emphasis mine) and "steps should be taken so that the faithful may also be able to say or to sing together in Latin those parts of the Ordinary of the Mass which pertain to them."

      <category>Travel;Canada;Other - Canada</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>You won't find any in Alberta because they live in the ocean and Alberta is inland.  You can see them in BC.  You probably won't see them in Vancouver, but you may see them on a whale watching Kayak trip.  They are fairly common in Johnstone Straight or you could go south to the San Juan Islands in Washington State and have a good chance of seeing some: &lt;a href="http://www.squidoo.com/San_Juan_Island" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.squidoo.com/San_Juan_Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Since the weather in April a...</answer>
        <answer>Well, not in Alberta, that's for sure. No ocean there. No ocean = no orcas. Most of the kayaking tours seem to run from June onwards, possibly because before that it's too cold and rainy for most people to want to kayak. The water is generally pretty cold on the BC coast. No harm in googling "orca kayaking" or something like it and contacting a few companies. You'll probably have to travel to Vancouver Island to see any orcas. They aren't seen very often around Vancouver.</answer>

From Hanoi you can go to Ha Long Bay and in Saigon you can visit the Cuchi Tunnels (Amazing experience) or the Mekong Delta (also great).

      <title>I wanna Make my Stock Chevy go fast, quick.?</title>
      <detail>I've got an 89 Chevy with a 350, 700r turbo tranny and custom exhuast. Now I plan on removing the exhaust I have on it in the future, when I install my headers. Can anyone here give me any other Cheap alternitives, that I might be able to do in a shorter time period, than what it takes to buy, headers, cats, mufflers, etc... that stuff. I've been told that cold air intake gives the most horse power. But will it cost less than all three of those at once? Basically what I'm asking is what procedures should I take to get the most horsepower out of my truck if i'm going to piece it together one performance part at a time. If anyone could Break it down for me... I'd love it, thanks Luke</detail>

        <answer>There is no such thing as cheep horse power.    Headers, cold air intakes...all that crap MIGHT give you an extra 30 to 40 HP, but wont change the torque curves. In essence, unless your going to run the engine at 5 to 6 thousand RPM all the time, all of the modifications talked about will make it sound cool, but any real HP gain is negligible.    And if you spend the money on the engine, the transmission, suspension, drive line and differential will also need to be up graded.    Remember that HP...</answer>

      <category>Travel;Asia Pacific;Malaysia</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Apparently there are quite a number of outlets for Thai food ingredients in the Klang Valley, but we do not seem to get to know where they are located. If you were to ask those who operate Thai food outlets they won't tell you; for fear of competition?</answer>
        <answer>I would suggest you to go to Thai Market that nearby Thai Buddhist temple at Jalan Gasing in Petaling Jaya. There are stalls sell Thai foods. They also sell a large variety of Thai ingredients or stuffs that you need to cook at home. Besides that Thai magazines and newspapers are available too.

        <answer>No, according to Fox, W did everything right all the time &amp; it was the nasty liberals that stopped him from ascending into heaven on the wings....I can't do it....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But yeah, Fox never really attacked him the same way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were too busy addressing the pressing matter of renaming those un-American pieces of fried potato in the cafeteria</answer>
        <answer>Yes I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I spoke out against our being in Iraq when he was President, I spoke out against the tax cuts, I spoke out against the Patriot Act and FISA, I spoke out against Homeland Security, I spoke out against the TSA...funny thing is, when I speak out against those things now, you liberals call me a racist for some reason.</answer>
        <answer>Do you remember Dubai port fiasco? It was from the pressure of his own people that this deal did not happen. He also had a Supreme Court nominee that he was forced to withdraw.

        <answer>Alexander.  That whole "western civilization" thing he got rolling turned out to be a big mistake.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Plus, we're bogged down in Afghanistan again, just like back in his day.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Although to be fair, it's not Alexander's fault that Americans won't read history..&lt;br&gt; .</answer>
        <answer>Alexander the Great. If he hadn't pushed himself so hard to conquer so quickly, he might have lived long enough to conquer the known world which would lead to, after several generations, world domination. If that had happened, we would all be one nation and we wouldn't need to spend money on an army or nuclear weapons, weapons development, or border security. There would also be no starvation or wars. Things would be a lot better.</answer>

        <answer>Unfortunately the Foreign Office is unable to change the courts mind. Whilst I regard the death penalty as a horrible, savage form of punishment she did know the law and the airports clearly show on signs that drug smugglers and dealers will be executed. She was silly enough to try it and must pay the consequences.</answer>
        <answer>I imagine they will feel obligated to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am against what she did, and think she was a total fool to do what she did in a country *known* for not allowing anyone to take the pi$$ out of them when it comes to their laws, but I do feel uncomfortable with her being executed, because I don't agree with execution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I wouldn't want to insist on my rules/personal beliefs being hoisted on to this country, and I don't think the Foreign Office should try throwing their weight around ...</answer>
        <answer>No , she deserves everything she has coming to her , she took the risk and now must take the punshment. The best thing she has going for her is the fact that she is British and we all know that our Government will step in as they always seem to do and give it their best shot at saving her and i have a feeling that they might actually be sucessful so she will probably end up serving maybe 15 to 20 years in prison which will do at a push so long as her time is served over there rather than bringin...</answer>
        <answer>Hello,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the last 30 years the government there has made it perfectly clear that anyone caught with over 200 grams of a narcotic shall dance the New Gate Polka at the end of a rope. All other methods in dealing with drugs were tried since the 50's and did not work they say. There are several races and religions over there and race relations are often fragile at best. Hence there is no discrimination or favouritism about those who shall hang and being white will not save you at all. She...</answer>
        <answer>Yes. Regardless of how silly she was and how much this has been brought on by herself I believe that no person with their heart in the right place would feel she deserves to be killed. The British government does not believe in the death penalty and therefore should use their influence to reach a compromise that prevents a needless death.</answer>

        <answer>I'm not familiar with Bloodshed. Compared to Visual Studio, it's about on par. Different, but on par.&lt;br&gt;  VS is snappier, but buggy. Sometimes I want to curse at it, but for .NET development you can't beat it.&lt;br&gt;  Eclipse is sluggish, but it has support for a TON of languages. Sometimes I get impatient with it, but for anything outside of .NET development it's really tops.</answer>
        <answer>Well, it's a freeware as you said :D&lt;br&gt;  And the best part of Eclipse is the plug-ins. There are over 1500 plugins that can be installed onto the application one develops. I don't think anyone has ever heard of any plug-ins for visual studio.

      <title>1996 Stock Chevrolet Pick-up dual-inlet or single-inlet?</title>
      <detail>1996 stock/standard Chevrolet 1500, it is not Z-71, I think its a 350, whatever is from factory. There is a single muffler coming out the rear right side of the truck, but that wouldn't make a difference whether or not it is dual or single inlet. If you need any more information I will do my best to tell you.   I want to put flowmasters on my fiance's truck and I spoke with a guy @ a muffler shop, he needs to know if I want dual-in, dual-out or single-in, dual-out. I have no clue and if I ask my fiance he will know what I'm doing. So if there are any mechanics or car specialists out there that may know, please give me a clue. Thanks</detail>

      <answers>
        <answer>If the exhaust you have now is the factory setup then its probably a dual inlet/single outlet. what I would do would be to go with two mufflers single inlet/ single outlet. That would be a TRUE dual exhaust. But for the money you can go with a single muffler dual in/dual out  and give the appearence of Dual exhaust. Your Fiance would be happy with either choice I'm sure ( all men like dual exhaust LOL).</answer>

        <answer>The Rhine Research Center is a parapsychology research organization in Durham, NC.  It was originally founded by J.B. Rhine who was a member of the Psychology department at Duke University.  Rhine helped to convince the faculty at Duke University that there was a value in the study of these unexplained, but seemingly regularly experienced phenomena.  Rhine helped to define the parameters of parapsychological study and brought the scientific method to the study of these phenomena.  Also, Rhine wa...</answer>
        <answer>The Duke University parapsychology lab was set up by William McDougall (link below) who hired J.B. Rhine who became it's director. Before Dr. Rhine retired from Duke University he transfered all of the funding to a new foundation (which eventually became Rhine Research Center) off the campus of Duke University. This information can be found on their web page with the history link.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Psiexploration</answer>

I don't think that an animal's personality can be decided by its species.</answer>

      <title>Technology is getting worse? Apple, EA, Windows, everything?</title>
      <detail>I am a Mac user who uses lots of programs such as Photoshop. OS X Lion is an awful step back from the previous OS as with the new Mission Control I can't even find all my windows in all my spaces like I could in Expose. Apple is even phasing out the mouse which I find is easier than the trackpad for precision, especially with photo editing, and they're just over simplifying and dumbing down the desktop with clunky features like Launchpad...  Mountain Lion is continuing this and even introducing "GateKeeper" which will end up with the desktop being a closed system where you can't even download from the internet - like the iPhone.    The Sims 3, on a different par, is also awful in comparison to it's predecessor, The Sims 2. The graphics are worse, there is less control over the community and you are even only limited to one community. It's just awful. And in addition to all this! Windows is going to follow Apple's lead and try to create an "overly simple mobile-esque desktop" rather than the desktop we're used to in Windows 8, so there's no escape!  My question is - why is technology getting worse? Aren't things supposed to be improving?!</detail>

        <answer>Stay in your own country</answer>
        <answer>check with your bank if they have a branch in Switzerland, or apply for a job in a Swiss Bank In your country, you might be transfered if you are very good worker.  Must learn either German or French though, English is not sufficient.</answer>
        <answer>Yes if  you do have a really extraordinary qualification that enables you to compete on the world job market.     Otherwise there is no chance. Just to work for a bank is not good enough. It is much easier for the bank to hire a local candidate.</answer>

      <title>Vatican Investigates theologian who violates dogma: what do you think?</title>
      <detail>Father Phan, a native of Vietnam, is a former president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. In an essay that touches on some themes of his book, he writes, A pluralistic theology serves as a strong reminder to Christians that non-Christian religious traditions may and indeed do contain teachings and practices that will help Christians know and love God.    http://chronicle.com/news/article/3024/v...  http://www.commonwealmagazine.org/articl...</detail>
      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Religion &amp; Spirituality</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I honestly don't see why the Vatican is even interested in this person. People spread lies about the Church all the time. What has he said that made him more important than all the other average Joes that hate Catholics?    Although, I can't say I'm very fond of the new Pope yet. He doesn't seem very smart and I don't think the position pleases him.</answer>
        <answer>The Catholic Theological Society of America at times borders on anti-Catholicism.  Sounds ridiculous, but true.  If you were the label Catholic, you really should be loyal to Catholicism.  There is a lot of room in theology for inquiry and study.    If they continue to advocate non-Catholic ideas, then perhaps they should just become the Theological Society of America.  But then, who would care what they say?</answer>
        <answer>In the country of Vietnam the majority of the populace are Buddhist.  Approximately 85 to 90 percent actually.  He grew up observing and learning from them also more than likely.  Where is the harm in what he says?</answer>
        <answer>The Vatican is not going to give up their claim to a special relationship to God, although it is entirely ficticious and arrogant on the part of the papacy.  Although some non-Christian teachings, such as some of those that the Mormons believe in, will help people lead a better life, knowing and loving God comes only with a relationship with Him and acceptance of Jesus as the Savior of all believers.</answer>

        <answer>Obama can, he wants to be reelected and will say or do anything legal or not.</answer>
        <answer>.  It is required they give 60 day notice to people before layoffs but it is very unlikely anyone is going to be laid off.  If no one is laid off no law has been broken.  If I worked for Lockheed I would feel more secure knowing the President is basically saying there will be no layoffs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So he is not telling them to break the law, he is telling them there are going to be no layoffs in 60 days, so there is no need to send out notices.</answer>

        <answer>Child soldiers are common in the DRC, less so in the Sudan and I'm not sure about the CAR. The DRC is virtually lawless and child soldiers are often brutalised to the point they will commit any atrocity you care to name. So the effect of their use is generally devastating for all concerned. I believe that they are also common in Uganda (Lords Resistance Army) but less so in Sudan.</answer>

      <title>What is the best time of year for a Motorcycle trip to Cape Breton Island?</title>
      <detail>I live in Maine and am an avid motorcyclist. I want to take a trip to Cape Breton Island with my brother to mark his 60th birthday. Can anyone recommend the best time to go? I'm sure someone reading this has done this trip right and I'd like to hear their story and advice.  Many thanks.</detail>
      <category>Travel;Canada;Other - Canada</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The best time for road trips in Cape Breton is the early Fall.  The weather is absolutely gorgeous that time of year.  It is still warm during the day and it cools off in the evening.  Most of the tourists are gone - the kids are back in school - but the attractions, restaurants and motels are still open.  If you go around the Cabot Trail, you're going to have a terrific trip.  Make sure you give yourself plenty of time so you can go down the side roads and off the beaten path.  Good travels!</answer>
        <answer>I would recommend anytime from mid May to mid to late August.  There are fewer tourists after mid August, but the weather is still very warm.  May also has few tourists, and the weather can be beautiful.  As part of the trip consider taking the ferry across to Newfoundland for another awesome experience.  Have fun!</answer>
        <answer>The weather in Cape Breton is pretty much the same as Maine so whenever you'd normally ride at home is good riding in Cape Breton too. In July and August there will be more traffic on the roads but it's never very bad.</answer>

      <title>Are there any symbols associated with St. Anthony of Padua (other than the lily)?</title>
      <detail>I am considering getting a tattoo of St Anthony. I am  not exactly "religious". I consider myself agnostic,  although raised Catholic. However, once I learned of  St Anthony, anytime I have EVER prayed to him to  recover a lost article, sure enough, I would find it  within minutes. I would like to have a him with me at  all times, and think a tattoo is apropos. I only have  one other tattoo, a heart inside an achor, on my left  foot. I am extremely specific about placing, content  and size of tattoos. I do not necessarily want the  portrait of him with the christ child, nor do I simply  want a lily. Hence, I am looking for some sort of  symbolic emblem that would be specific enough as to  denote him, but possibly ambiguous enough to entail  intagible ideas as peace.    Now that you have some background, maybe where you can see where I am coming from. I would love to receive  answers that would be fitting of all criteria, but  please do answer with anything you know of St Anthony  that would be symbolic.</detail>
      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Religion &amp; Spirituality</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The traditional images associated with St. Anthony are a book, bread, the Baby Jesus, or a lily. Here are some images to look at for inspiration:    http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/sta...</answer>
        <answer>I don't wish to sound argumentative, but I'm curious as to how you can consider yourself agnostic while at the same time praying to St. Anthony--That's a bit of a contradiction, isn't it?  Especially if your prayers are being answered.  I mean; who do you think he is praying to on your behalf?--    But to answer your question; it's commonly the Child Jesus, a lilly and a book that are symbolically associated with St. Anthony of Padua.</answer>
        <answer>It is not right to have a tattoo. Leviticus 19:28 says-- "Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you; I am the Lord."    And besides we are not suppose  to pray to saints. We should only pray to our Lord Jesus Christ.</answer>

      <title>I have a baseball signed by Otis Nixon, Ken Griffey, George Foster, Ferguson Jenkins"Fergie", ?</title>
      <detail>Any idea on a value?</detail>
      <category>Sports;Baseball</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>It would actually be worth more if just Jenkins signed it.  He's the only HOFer of the bunch.  Since there's no connection between the four of them having the other 3 signatures actually hurts the value.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I'm assuming that's Ken Griffey Sr. </answer>
        <answer>About $25-$40 or whatever someone is willing to pay.  Only Jenkins ia a HOFer and not a big name.  Reds fans may be intrigued by the Griffey and Foster names, but few people know much about Nixon.</answer>
        <answer>If you can get Princess Fergie  to sign it, it might be worth something.</answer>
        <answer>No idea man. I have a few Griffey signed rookies that are mint. Have to find those values as well.</answer>

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>A lot.  Use a 2-D backdrop of the world and tell Americans they're in it.&lt;br&gt;  They'll never miss the real thing, right?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Then you can continue to tell them they are paid more than others.</answer>
        <answer>It's debatable that any could be saved.&lt;br&gt;  The UN has many functions that the US makes use of for international relations.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  We would have to expand our state department to fill the gap.</answer>
        <answer>most countries wouldn't have a problem with that as long as the US loses its veto power in the UN too</answer>
        <answer>Ha ha, this is a trick question of course! NOTHING! The usa still owes contribution of a billion dollars per year since the Reagan years!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  How much money will be lost if the United States pulled out of the UN?&lt;br&gt;  about 10 billion dollars per year, so staying in the UN gives the USA about 9 billion dollars per year ... ok 10 billion, since they don't pay their contribution anyway.</answer>

      <detail>So why isn't everyone blaming George Bush, global warming, and second-hand smoke?</detail>
      <category>Science &amp; Mathematics;Astronomy &amp; Space</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Because everybody knows the cause is something else. Huge Martian nuclear missles are opening. That mountain in the images is their version of NORAD.     More seriously, they're just avalanches. George Bush, global warming, and second-hand smoke is not responsible. I pity you for even asking this question. "So why isn't" implies that you believe people should blame those for it.    I will pray for you.</answer>
        <answer>Wasn't it a landslide, not an avalanche?  That being besides the point, this landslide that was photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, was probably caused by naturally-occurring temperature fluctuations between the Sun and Mars' icy surface, thus triggering the slide.</answer>

      <title>Is Kiev a nice city to visit?</title>
      <detail>Hi, I really find the Ukraine to be an interesting country but I'm just curious to see what people have to say about Kiev. Is Kiev a nice city to visit in your opinion?</detail>
      <category>Travel;Europe (Continental);Other - Europe</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Kiev is an absolute fabulous city to visit ( proberbly one of the nicest cities in europe )  There are many fabulous historic buildings, and many places to visit. The centre is very cosmoploiton with designer shops etc. There are some beautiful parks with wonderful views over the dnipr river to the eastern bank. Yep kiev is definately worth a vist, but do learn some basic language skills before you go and get a good guide book.</answer>
        <answer>I love Kiev! I lived there for awhile and fell in love with it, but I know others didn't because it was not as romantic. However, I say don't miss Kiev. It has too much History (probably why it is not so romantic), but there are such great things about it. The Pechersk Lavra is really cool, so are the Cathedrals (there are so many) St. Sofias and St. Michaels are both beautiful. Don't miss Maiden Square/ Square of independence. I loved it...but it depends on why you want to go.</answer>
        <answer>I've been in Ukraine about half a dozen times. Only ever passed through Kiev, looks ok, big, industrialised. Lviv in the west looked nicer and has a very impressive train station. I tended to visit smaller cities, large cities aren't really my thing.</answer>
        <answer>I've never been, but I'd go right away if I could. Every capital in Europe without exception deserves a visit.</answer>
        <answer>yes, especially around New year and Christmas time (not Christmas is celebrated on January )</answer>

        <answer>Firstly, i have to say, there are many places that you can spend all your time. one or two weeks might not be enough to visit every place in worth.    The Bosphorus might be thought as the most beautiful part of istanbul. It brings Asia and Europa together that there is approximately one or two km between these continents. There are two bridges which connect the continents. People who live in any side and go to work to the other side, alter their continent that they stand on 10 times a week :)  ...</answer>
        <answer>trying to avoid getting mugged, stabbed, shot, etc. should keep you entertained for a while.</answer>
        <answer>Yup, there's a huge market where you can  get almost everything.  Gorgeous mosques,  Zillions of historical places going back 3000  years.    If you like travel generally, its a great place -  you need to dress conservatively, by American  standards.    You can get spectactular deals there on  oriental rugs - but you can be scammed as well.    Checking in:  "I'd like a non smoking room..."  Registrar:  "But sir, none of our rooms smoke!"</answer>
        <answer>check out the bazaar and St Sophia mosque. lots of nice restaurants. its nice to sit down by the river in the evening and watch the men fishing. have a great time</answer>
        <answer>i live in istanbul, i have been here for about 2 years, and i am 18, it depends what age you are, but there are many tourist sites, plenty of mosque, the aquaducts, topkapi palace, galatasry tower, gran bazaar, spice bazaar. night life is great, when going, dont' get ripped off, they life targeting americans, and orientals, there is loads of information on the internet though</answer>

      <detail>Well.  I was just wondering, my dad is looking for a new car for up to 120k because he wants to get rid of his old Toyota corolla and get a good car for when I go to college. and the best car (spec wise) I can see is the Jaguar xjl supersport, top end new one for only 113,000 MSRP, which means it can go lower.  I HATE LEXUS'S. So i will steer him away from those overpriced sofa's with good reliability hehehhe.  So, my only question is, does Jaguar still have its notorious reliability it had when it had its old model line up? (broken engines, electrical problems, bad transmission).

        <answer>Good or bad? 3 incredible courses, so it would probably be tough to be bad.    What kind of golfer are you? If you are pretty good, then it will be an amazing challenge for you.

        <answer>There all great courses, but you will have to bring your A game. Just when you think you've got the course down, it throws in a few more quirks.

        <answer>Why not? Life is an adventure and McMurdo would be quite the adventure. I would probably have to be a cook or some other menial job as I am not a scientist. I could go there as a writer if I got a gig from a magazine to write about what goes on there and describe the place and the activities, history, etc.    But Yeah, why not?

      <detail>For this 2008 election.</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Ronald Reagan. I would vote for him against most other candidates against whom you could match him.  John Kennedy was a well liked and virtually ineffective President who accomplished little in his two years in office but did screw up lots of things.  He gave us the Bay of Pigs fiasco which left Castrpo in power  He traded away our missiles in Turkey ( quietly though so on one knew it) to get Russian missles out of Cuba.  He got us into the Vietnam war.  On the other hand he had a good looking a...</answer>
        <answer>Ronald Reagan.................</answer>
        <answer>In addition to being ressurected, are they also returned to the prime of life or some such?      Because, barring Alzhiemers, it'd have to be Reagan.  But, either would be better than the current roster.  Both would be perfectly willing to finally win the war, for instance.</answer>
        <answer>Am a voting based on their personality and political beliefs, or based on what happened during their presidencies?  If they were both campaigning today, I would probably vote for Kennedy.  However, knowing that he will soon be shot and his vice president would take over and start a useless war, Ill take Regan.</answer>

      <category>Travel;Europe (Continental);Netherlands</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>As has been said not all the roads are 'bricked'. (I would prefer 'blocked'). &lt;br&gt;  Motorways for instance are the same as other European countries, and are either tarmaced or concreted, as are other main roads.&lt;br&gt;  What you will find, however is that lots of street roads in residential areas are indeed 'blocked'.&lt;br&gt;  As for expense..... To build a tarmac road think --- hardcore and machinery to level it, then machines to lay the tarmac (at least three layers if new) plus waggons leading in th...</answer>
        <answer>They're not ALL bricked but there are a lot of bricked roads in the Netherlands.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Holland is quite wet and those roads go back a couple hundred years to well before cars. Think horses, carriages, buggies and a wet environment on dirt roads.</answer>

      <category>Travel;Switzerland;Geneva</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>It depends on when in the week and what time of day you want to leave, but you can go from Geneva Gare (Main train station) to Bern and switch trains to go to Interlaken (there are two stations: Ost (East) and West).It will take just under 3 hours.    It will cost you about 63 SFR for one way, or, if you can buy a Halb-Tax (Half-Fare) it is 31.50 SFR    Go to the sbb website, click on EN for english and type in your request.  Here is a sample:  http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en?...    Reme...</answer>
        <answer>Most train stations in switzerland have travel agent-type people to help you out in getting from place to place, they can even print tickets for your entire journey.    Also, if you're not swiss, you should look into getting a halb-tax (sp?), which will cost like 90 francs for the month and you'll get all your rail fares at half price.</answer>
        <answer>There are only two mainline (ie: not commuter train) stations in Geneva: Geneve Aeroport and Geneve Gare Centrale (airport and main). If you're flying in, you'll want the airport. If you're taking a train from France, you just have to go to the other end (CFF) of the same station; it should be quite easy to follow. Just look for "CFF" which are the French initials of the Swiss railroad, or something like "trains en Suisse" and/or blue signs with white writing.    As far as I know, all mainline t...</answer>

        <answer>Very nice, Istanbul's the best city in Turkey in my opinion (since my family's from turkey, i've been there alot!) but tru to go see other natural beauties around there especially the historic sights around there are just beautiful, go shopping around there too of course!, but believe me just spending one day there is enough to make anyone happy no matter what place you got see.</answer>
        <answer>Better to divide the day into two. Half in SultanAhmet which is the old city and there you can visit Topkapi Palace, Saint Sophia, Blue Mosque and the afternoon at the Bhosphorus, where you can take a small boat trip on Bhosphorus. Hope you enjoy.</answer>
        <answer>Wander around the streets of Sultanhamet.  It's the touristy bit, but worth seeing because it's so different to western cities.  The Blue Mosque is free to get into and no queues, Aghia Sofia takes more time.  A Turkish bath is wonderful if you have a couple of hours, and there's lots around. If the weather's nice, walk along the Marmaris shore, then walk back into the hustle via the narrow streets of dilapidated wooden houses.  Talk to all the children - they love to practice their English, esp...</answer>

      <title>1994 Jaguar XJS Help! Trunk Won't Open!?</title>
      <detail>I have a 1994 Jaguar XJS and the trunk will not open. The battery is dead, and the battery is in the trunk. The keys we have don't open the trunk either (for a reason I am unsure, maybe they are both valet keys?). We tried to remove the back seats, however, I wasn't able to do it because I can't figure out how, I removed the bottom of the back seats, and just kind of made a mess..I know there is this thing you can buy to jump your battery through the cigarette lighter fuse, but my fuse for that hasn't been working well either.  I really need to get in the trunk, so I would like to know if there is a way to do it, if you know anyway to do it, even an improvement on what I've already tried it would be GREATLY appreciated. Also, if you know where the fuse box is in the car so I could get a new fuse for the cigarette lighter plug, could you include that information? and where you could buy one of those things to jump the battery through that port?

        <answer>It will not rise</answer>
        <answer>Ok... i think: 58m&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Because, you take the average depth (2700m) divided by 1.4exp21 because kg of water is the same as litres (with pure water the density is 1, not sea water, but I ignored that) this gives you the depth given by 1 litre of water.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Then you take this number, and times it by the number of litres you have in Antarctica, 3exp19. Which gives you 57.857m&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Obviously again this is based on the average depth you gave.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Edit: Hmm, took me ages to f...</answer>

      <detail>Google chrome VS firefox</detail>
      <category>Computers &amp; Internet;Internet;Other - Internet</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>They are both good browsers.I cannot tell which one is better. &lt;br&gt;Chrome is faster and firefox is more stable.&lt;br&gt;Another browser I think good is Avant browser which has both firefox engine and chrome engine. That's useful for me.</answer>
        <answer>Chrome it syncs everything for you without having to set anything up or configure not to mention a bunch of features that you can't get in any other browser. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I used FF for about 12 years its a great browser but requires a lot of configuration and lacks a lot of features I expect from a browser in 2012 I dont care to constantly be installing 3rd party addons from shady sources to get it to work the way I want it to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both have their advantages and disadvantages but Chrome is the bet...</answer>
        <answer>according to me google chrome is better than mozilla firefox because it has more features than firefox like it has omnibar etc. also it runs faster with less adds and the settings and options are easier to use while in firefox it always freeze and its options are kind of complicated. You can check this out on the net as several websites have discussion on this topic</answer>
        <answer>Firefox. I have been using it for like ever and never had a problem with it. Firefox loads up pretty fast on my rig also. Download the Adblocker addon for firefox if you have it. I never get anymore ads when I watch videos or go on sites. As far as the settings for firefox, it's not that hard to understand. Ya just have to read and there's quite a bit of settings which applies to firefox's flexibility and stuff life that.&lt;br&gt;Firefox ftw.</answer>
        <answer>Have been using Firefox since I came to know about the Internet and guess what ? &lt;br&gt;I will say the best browser is chrome :D&lt;br&gt;Yes firefox is better if you stay on the older version. Upgrade to Version 14 and 15 and you will know what I mean. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chrome on the other hand works good. But i feel it is not the best at anything. I like the auto translate feature though. It comes in handy for me.</answer>

Di certo potrete dirmi: "ma ti svegli solo ora???", e avete ragione, ma ero gi convinta di non fare la profilassi per via di tutti quegli effetti collaterali, quando, documentandomi su internet, ho trovato il "MALARONE" che sembra risolvere tutti i miei problemi a parte il costo elevato... Ma quando sono andata dal medico per farmelo prescrivere, mi ha detto che devo controllare c/o la mia ASL all'ufficio igiene se la zona in cui andr (nord-est dell'isola)  clorochino-resistente, perch se cos fosse il Malarone non sarebbe efficace.

      <title>If he is afraid to Debate with HRC, how will he handle the actual DNC Convention?</title>
      <detail>It's no big secret that debating the issues is not Barack Obama's *strongest area.* In fact, Obama recently canceled an upcoming North Carolina Debate between himself and Hillary Clinton, after the last ABC debate with her... didn't go well.    Hillary keeps talking about taking this *all the way* to the convention.. . but is that because she knows Obama might actually *crack up* if he is forced into that process?    If Obama is afraid to just debate Hillary in public, will he feel motivated to drop out of the race completely if he knows he is doomed plead his case right along side of Hillary in front of the Credentials Committee?    Could this be the reason that Howard Dean is pressuring the Superdelegates to make their decisions early, to spare Obama from this exact scenario?    Judging by Obama's past debate performances, what do you think: would you expect Obama hold up pretty well at the convention, or would that just be an extremely over-optimistic speculation at this point?</detail>

We are told some of david's sunnah (such as fasting every other day).....and the whole trimming the arm pits and down below is abraham's sunnah.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  So it would be considered the sunnah of david at the very least. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I'm not sure if the prophet did it.</answer>

      <category>Sports;Football (Australian);Australian Rules</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Johnson is a mercurial player and can win games off his own boot but can he play in the midfield, as kaitalex said he'll have to work on his fitness levels that's for certain, aside from that problem i don;t think he can cut the mustard playing in the middle where the traffic is heavy, i just can't see him being of a lot of value in there.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; He likes the ball put out in front of him so he can do his stuff, and that is kick goals, it's what he is best at, i don't see why they need him in t...</answer>
        <answer>He will have to work very hard on his fitness, as he is usually blowing heavily after a goal. I also think he is going to have to improve a fair bit on his ball gathering skills, because now it is he doing the delivering. I think he is a talented forward, and geelong must be scratching to be trying it, I would have thought they would have been scouting for Abletts replacement at the start of last year, but that is bombers arrogance at work there. Cheers mate</answer>
        <answer>That's a maybe! But if the tall forwards (Moons, J-Pod, Tomahawk) are not marking and kicking goals down at the Cattery because it's raining cats and dogs (assume it's Geelong and Footscray playing, hey?) then he has the sense to send him into the forward line!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I believe that the Cats WILL cover the absence of Ablett anyway with players like Chapman, Ling, Bartel, Corey, Enright in the midfield. As other respondents have said, has Stevie-J got the fitness to be an on-the-ball player?</answer>
        <answer>He doesn't have the engine for it. They would have been better going for Chapman in the midfield. Only time will tell though.</answer>
        <answer>Why would you he is a great forward why would you move him out of his comfort zone. His Kicked a few bags of 6 goals he can be a game changer.Shocking move.</answer>

When charging, the light should be flashing amber (orange).&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If you had done a battery reset and still having problems, you may need to purchase a new battery.

      <title>Why would the AAP oppose all female circumcision, but support male circumcisions?</title>
      <detail>The AAP is the American Academy of Pediatrics.  I could understand if the AAP was open to different cultural practices, which is why they would support male circumcision, but why would they reject all forms of female circumcisions with no questions asked? I'm pretty sure the Africans around the world who practice female circumcision could make claims about preventing diseases and lowering the chances of STD's on circumcised women, and yet the AAP doesn't even attempt to investigate or research, they just flat out deny female circumcision.  Why the double standard?  In 2010 the AAP said, "the AAP is totally opposed to all forms of female genital cutting, both here in the U.S. and anywhere else in the world," said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey."  In 2012 the AAP said about male circumcision, "...scientific research shows clearer health benefits to the procedure than had previously been demonstrated..."  Why wouldn't the AAP extend these health benefits to women?</detail>

        <answer>There is quite a bit of cultural bias with this. In the US female circumcision is often said to be to be done only to lessen sexual pleasure and is done under unsanitary conditions. Like MGM (male circumcision), FGM does always harm sexual pleasure. However, most FGM is the cutting of the labia and clitoral hood (NOT THE CLITORIS) and it is normally done in a hospital setting. Women say the sex is fine, say it is cleaner and they want it done to their daughters. These practices deprive the owner...</answer>
        <answer>Think about this for a moment. If the AAP just came right out &amp; admitted that circumcision was harmful, a huge backlash would occur and they would be sued by thousands possibly millions of American men who would then become upset over what happened to them when they were babies. The religious whackos who endorse circumcision would probably label an anti-circumcision policy as "hate speech" and the AAP would be forced to retract their statement. Political correctness is a poison. The real world i...</answer>
        <answer>I think there are reasons that people did it in the old world and today they are finding that out. circumcised males they found out in a aids research passed along aids much less often then non circumcised males.

Stuff develops, and sometimes when you get a swollen 'area' it swells up over the head of it, can you imagine the pain. So I think there was something that made these...</answer>
        <answer>I don't know, especially since male circumcision is typically done on infants who can do nothing but scream and fall asleep.  Maybe that's why.  Little girls can remember their pain and humiliation.  Baby boys can't remember.  That's a shitty reason to deny protection to infants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT:  Sarah, you should totally Google thatshit.  Ooh, do an image search!  Turn your Safesearch filter off!

        <answer>he would have becasue the 23 year old was quicker a better boxer &amp; was just as tough.

Ali even said he was better as older in the movie 'When We Were Kings'.The Liston and Foreman fights had one thing in common though - they were fixed! That was definitely not the same Foreman that stepped into the ring in Africa, that pummelled Frazier. The Liston punch didn't even land. It was no more than a graze at best, and Ali was stepping straight back when thr...</answer>

If you find Vancouver is too quiet then Toronto has a bigger nightlife and arts scene.  They're both very unique and suit different kinds of people but I would say that Vancouver just beats Toronto as it's got the same amount of diversity but ...</answer>

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I'm not a Republican, but I'm opposed to ANY tax increase on anyone. I do not believe the government needs more money. What they need to do is control their spending, and the money saved from that can go to all these "feel good" programs the Democrats want to put in place.</answer>
        <answer>Bill Gates, is that where your little airhead led you?  That tax will be on the large corporations that keep us employed and when they make cuts to cover the increase in taxes those cuts will be our jobs!  What is it you don't get about that?  Do your history homework and you will see, it happens everytime!  Also don't be fooled into thinking that those tax increases are not going to be for everyone who makes 40K and over, I would bet my life on it!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I am not opposed to saving anyones ...</answer>
        <answer>Blue collar auto workers are the reason for the increases in the cost of cars, if they would cut out all the BS their Unions make and pass it on to the workers then they would not be hurting to begin with.  Taxation on anyone at a time like this is a disaster waiting to happen.  Yet, don't worry we will have a tax increases especially when Obama lets the tax cuts under Bush expire- your taxes will go up.  </answer>
        <answer>"That's because republicans have this "trickle theory".(I can't remember if I heard that phrase somewhere, or just made that up one time to help me describe this in a debate...) Anyway. They believe that by helping out the rich, the profits that the rich make will trickle down the social ladder to the middle and lower classes. It's bullsh*t, but that's the theory."&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  We subscribe to no such theory. This "trickle down economics" is not a real economics theory. It's a politically partisan...</answer>
        <answer>Bill Gates made his money honestly. Those Union auto workers have been soaking us for years, by being overpaid and under worked, the unions have destroyed the industries by greed, no they do not deserve to be rescued, just brought into the real world.</answer>

      <detail>I have been accepted at  PSU &amp; PURDUE (main campuses) for engineering. I am fully aware of some stuff coming in support of purdue for engineering &amp; rightly so.      However, I am still not very interested in ENGINEERING though it is a priority. Initially I was keen on doing nuclear engg but owing to its' narrow prospects I am tending to shy away from it.      And thats the only engg dept PSU UPARK is good at - right ?? If not so please tell me.      Morever it is going to be amid   Pol Sc, Economics, International Relations  if its not going to be engg.  &amp;  I think PSU liberal arts is much superior to PURDUE.  However, in either of the majors I think I am not going to end up at either of these two unis( I'll try).      But if I have to graduate at either of these two only :-   which one has a better overall reputation - the academic one.      In engg Purdue is slightly over Penn State with the former placed at 11th &amp; latter at  17th  for engineering.  but overall which would be better since PSU ranks amid the 40's (was 35in 2006)  but PURDUE always between  60-70.      If Econ, Pol Sc, Int'l Relations then which one would be a better choice to start with.         Lastly where can I possibly transfer to from both the unis either in engg or soc sc.  as per their acceptability.         Is PSU- UPARK(public IVY) really worth it or old is GOLD -the purdue.

      <answers>
        <answer>The answer above gives excellent advice.  I would also recommend searching Craigslist in your area to see what other people are selling their kayaks for to judge the resale market there.  You may even find listings by people who want to buy a kayak like yours.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, if you want a quick sale on CL, you need to list at half the new price for nearly anything.  If you want as much as you are hoping to get, you will have a long wait.  At this time of year you also had better look at what...</answer>
        <answer>I'd would ask $400 if you want to sell it, and consider an offer of $350.  Used kayaks usually go for 50% (or lower) of retail price.  If your Perception Sport Caster has only been out one time then $450 might be possible.  You could use the link below as a selling point, on paddling.net most people rate it 8 - 9 out of 10.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck finding the right buyer.  And no it's not my type.  I'm a Sea Kayaker, Current Design - Caribou.</answer>

        <answer>Not an exact number but probably about 160 knots at landing weight based on a comparison with Concorde.  Both are highly swept deltas without flaps and a landing wing loading of about 40 psf.  I'll let you convert to international units as part of your engineering project.</answer>

        <answer>The Cabot Trail comes off the highway 105. The trail itself is on highway 19 but its more commonly just called the cabot trail.    To get to Cape Breton you take the highway 104 in mainland nova scotia.    There is no toll (the bridge portion is only a small portion), its mostly a causeway called the Canso Causeway.    I recommend checking out the highland national park or marble mountain while you're there :)</answer>

      <detail>This is a serious question for those who are fundamentalist biblical Christians.</detail>
      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Religion &amp; Spirituality</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Based on what the christian religion believes then yes he would be in hell.</answer>
        <answer>I suppose only God could answer this one correctly or Harvey Milk. Who of us is able to know the mind of God? None. In his mercy, anything is possible. Sin is not larger than God, and his final word or the what's, whys and etc. of the soul are his. I'll leave God's job to him on that decision, and hope I get some consideration when it's my turn up.</answer>
        <answer>I sure hope not, but I wish I could be more optimistic for him.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  to Digital: I've lived in the bay area since before Milk was in office and have never heard that Dan White was "saved," and I doubt he was (sadly for him also).</answer>
        <answer>Even if you may percieve him as a "great man with great intentions" you need to understand even the rightous mans works are like dirty rags before the Lord. We all have fallen short of His glory.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If he did not accept and love the truth, he is left to himself.</answer>

      <category>Computers &amp; Internet;Internet;Google</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>There is, presently, a pre-alpha version for the Ubuntu repositories.   Apparently, for a pre-alpha, it's pretty stable (see the first link if you have Ubuntu).&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  But the final is supposed to come out sometime in June.  I can't find the site that said that now; most of them say mid-2009.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Also, I thought I'd add: the pre-alpha is Chromium, not Chrome.</answer>
        <answer>CNET reported that they would release the final version for Linux by the first half of the year.</answer>
        <answer>Here is a link to a page that Chrome has to sign up for updates on the Chrome for Linux browser.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/linux.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/lin...&lt;/a&gt;</answer>

      <category>Cars &amp; Transportation;Car Makes;Mitsubishi</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Young drivers should never car shop until they have talked to their insurance agent.  Price depends on where you live and how much coverage you need.  It will probably be much more than another car because these have a pretty bad record on the street, lots of tickets and collisions.  You are being judged by the actions of other drivers.</answer>

        <answer>Cardiff is the capital of Wales, and also the largest city in Wales.&lt;br&gt;  London is the capital of England, and also largest city in UK.&lt;br&gt;  Cardiff is much smaller than London, but yes it is a capital city of a country.&lt;br&gt;  If Wales became independant like the republic of Ireland, it would be more like a European capital.</answer>
        <answer>Cardiff is a very pleasant small city.  It has a compact city centre with all the usual stores, a castle, a lovely park and beautiful civic buildings.  Just a short bus ride or a 15 minute walk away, you can get to Cardiff Bay, which is a redeveloped area by the sea with shops, cafes, restaurants, theatre, cinema and the Welsh parliament building.</answer>

        <answer>Well, that should have been the least of his problems, and though I am a huge MJ fan, he was extremely naive. I mean it is not like the media were his friends and they create names and identities for people to sell papers. The media is immune to such sensitivity and sentimentality, and even if he didn't like it, he should have gotten over it because when the media realised they can get him to feel bad, they became a lot worse.</answer>
        <answer>I think its horrible how the media called him Wacko Jacko,regardless if u like the man or not-he's a human being. The media would criticize or tell lies abt their own mother to make a buck!&lt;br&gt;  MJ was the most sweetest,loving,and generous man and the media tried there best to hurt him,that is just sickening all the lies and stuff they told!</answer>
        <answer>yea. sad. he gave all he had to this world, and yet people still treated him like trash. people shuld be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br&gt;  people, its not jacko its JACKSON! get it straight.&lt;br&gt;  i swear, if someone calls him wacko jacko in front of me, i'll punch them right in the face.</answer>
        <answer>awww! :'(&lt;br&gt;  he looks so innocent, serious, and sad when he said " im not a jacko, im a jackson"&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  aw poor michael. i felt terrible watching that. im not only a fan of his music but his personality. its so sweet and loving... apparently something no one has today.</answer>

      <title>How will the democrats handle GWB's executive order to reign in earmarks which he'll be signing today?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>They've proved to be quite the spineless bunch so far, so I suspect they'll keel over and do what the president says.</answer>
        <answer>The one democrat from Nu Ark will be wetting her pants, bitching and moaning calling the President a SOB. she had her pork going to a black pastor in NU ARK to get the black vote, sooo sorry charlie, gonna have to bilk some other ugly senator.some of these so called church pastors will have to go get a real job now. right on GW   GO GEORGE GO</answer>
        <answer>They will attempt to get them done through congress but at least they will now be out in the open for all to see.  I believe in the long run, they too will have to come to reality and see that earmarks are no good for the country, we just don't have the money for pet projects.  Oh, they will fight and go kicking and screaming, but they will lose, America is tired of pork barrel spending and pet projects.</answer>
        <answer>Ignore the moron.    Here's a lesson on how the USA government works:  Bush has no authority to tell Congress what they can or cannot put in their spending bills other than vetoing the bills that they put on his desk.</answer>
        <answer>they will either fight it or ignore it just like every time hes tried to end the pork.</answer>

        <answer>Yeah, I have noticed that.  It is pretty nice!  I wonder if it's because they got tired of correcting people and criticizing how stupid a question it might've been(I noticed that a lot when answering questions).  Hopefully people will continue to be this tolerant.</answer>

      <category>Computers &amp; Internet;Hardware;Laptops &amp; Notebooks</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Geladen extern lagern, und alle 2-3 Monate einen kompleten Zyklus von entladen und laden durchführen. Für die Lagerung einen normal temperierten, trockenen Ort w?hlen. Auf keinen Fall in den Kühlschrank oder Gefrierschrank wie manche empfehlen. Akkus m?gen es weder zu warm noch zu kalt. Fotografen transportieren ihre Ersatzakkus im Winter m?glichst nah am K?rper um sie vor der K?lte zu schützen!</answer>

Du wirst es schon merken wenn die Leistung nach dem entfernen des Akkus nachl??t. Ach ja, der Akku kann durchaus auch als Gewichtsausgleich für dein Display dienen. Im schlimmsten Fall kann dein Notebook dann leichter nach vorne kippeln. Also ich lasse den Akku in meinem Sony AW11 M/H (18,4" Display) immer drinnen. Wenn der Akku sowieso nicht l?nger ...</answer>
        <answer>Wenn Du das Notebook als Desktop-Ersatz benützt w?re es besser den Akku rauszunehmen und alle 2-3 Monate mal zu entleeren und wieder aufzuladen. Ansonst verlieren die Akkus sehr schnell ihre Ladekapazit?t.</answer>

        <answer>Not really, I mean, I live in Moscow, Russia and I would never go to some parts of Moscow, but that's just like in any big city, FYI Moscow has a population of over 13 million people.&lt;br&gt;  I thinks that some US cities are more dangerous, people get mugged all the time in US, in US u can't walk one or the other road because it is dangerous, in Moscow one can take any road, as long as it's not a dark alley. We don't have blocks that are only for blacks or for latinos or etc, everything is mixed, i...</answer>
        <answer>Moscow is like Russia, Russia is like South side of Chicago-NOT GOOD!&lt;br&gt;  Because of the lack of money and all of that People there are really rude so if you look at them the wrong way, who knows whats gonna happen. During night, most of them are drunk so you dont even have to look at them wrong for them to start a fight.&lt;br&gt;  But its also not as bad as you might think. Just keep your hands to your self on your head on your shoulders. :)</answer>
        <answer>The Moscow metro is probably the safest in the world at midnight. You're more vulnerable on trains, but I wouldn't say that they're unsafe for a foreigner. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Like any capital city, some nightclubs are tourist friendly, a few aren't. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.inyourpocket.com/russia/Moscow/Nightlife" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.inyourpocket.com/russia/Mosco…&lt;/a&gt;</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>Io sono stata nella zona di Kiwengua, ed è bellissima, ma se vuoi un consiglio scegli la zona di Nungwi o addirittura Kendwa, sono meravigliose!!! Nella prima c'è un villaggio Going mentre a Kendwa c'è un Eden Village...oltre a ovviamente tante altre strutture.Dipende da cosa vuoi esattamente...ci sono molti posticini un po' spartani ma veramente carini che costano poco ma che hanno l'essenziale per stare bene...</answer>
        <answer>il Karaafu con Hotelplan oppure il Dongwe con i Grandi viaggi sono belli e mi sono trovato bene altri non li conosco personalmente</answer>
        <answer>Io credo propio che i migliori siano:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  EDEN VILLAGE KENDWA e il ROYA ZANZIBAR che è un Seaclub francorosso&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Sono all inclusive e il che non guasta visto che gli extra sono parecchio acri.&lt;br&gt;  Inoltre sono tutti e due posizionati a nord dell'isola , luogo ideale perchè durante le basse maree il mare non scompare come sulla costa est dove si trova ad esempio Kiwengwa.&lt;br&gt;  Sono anche i punti dove potrai osservare dei tramonti incantevoli e dei colri meravigiosi....&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  ...</answer>
        <answer>MyBlue resort nella parte nord dell'isola a Nungwi dove il fenomeno delle maree è quasi inesistente e quindi puoi sempre fare il bagno e non ci sono le coltivazioni di alghe che sono un po' fastidiose</answer>
        <answer>Ciao..io ti consiglio il villaggio della going a Kiwengwa: mare stupendo e spiaggia bellissima. Oppure pochi metri più in là(sempre a kiwengwa)il villaggio bravo club(ex francorosso). In questa parte dell'isola il fenomeno delle maree si sente molto, ogni 6 ore il mare si ritira ma è cmq una cosa caratteristica dell'isola quindi da vedere, poi appena le capisci ti adegui e riesci sempre a fare il bagno!</answer>

        <answer>Yes, they probably do think that she would be easier to beat in Nov. than Obama would be.     Although, while many Democrats seem to think that Obama is the next best thing to God, his record will come under greater scrutiny if he's elected.    Maybe this is just wishful thinking, but I think that there's a lot about Obama that's still not known -- and once it is known, people will think twice about him.       Right now he's riding a lot of hype and rhetoric about "change" and "hope."   But soon...</answer>
        <answer>I know when the primary was in Virginia the republicans were voting for Obama because they thought he was easiest to beat.</answer>

      <category>Education &amp; Reference;Higher Education (University +)</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Actually the MPhils at Oxford and Cambridge are taught degrees. The MPhil degrees tend to be two years long compared to a one year MSc such as Oxford's MSc in development economics or LSE's MSc in Local Economic Development. There may be exceptions to this pattern so I suggest you look at the course's structure and content rather than just it's degree title.</answer>

        <answer>This is a decent trade for you, you are set at WR with Megatron, Wallace and Bryant. You are certainly in need of another RB. Burner Turner had a bad game last week but he is still considered a top producing fantasy back. He will be your #1 and provide you a nice backfield with Hightower. You would be hard pressed to win with any of those committee backs: Tolber, Jacobs or Grant in as a starter for you. Definitely do the trade.</answer>

        <answer>For the same reason they have Christian, Orthodox, Buddhist, and Jewish areas - because groups of people who share the same religion decided at one time or another to settle in a particular place.  In many other areas the regions are more heterogeneous - while there are people of all faiths, the predominance of one faith or another is less pronounced.  Since religious freedom is observed in the Russian Federation, it really doesn't matter what people observe what religion in what area.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;...</answer>
        <answer>Russia is a vast country with a wide variety of geography and cultures. Remember that Russia didn't always used to be that large with as much influence as one might think. It wasn't until Peter the Great that Russia even began uniting under one flag, and that was in the early 1700s. Prior to that Russia was very isolated with the rest of the world and amongst itself. Russia is very wet, cold and snowy (speaking generally) so to get from one town to the other was very difficult, and even more dif...</answer>
        <answer>Well, first of all, Russia is no longer a Christian country. It's a democracy where all religions (at least the "traditional" ones) are equal. Second, Russia used to be an empire which had colonized other nations. However, unlike other powerful nations Russia did not force other nations to convert to their religion. Russians were Orthodox Christians and the core of the Orthodox Christian belief is that a religious choice must be made freely. God does not force us to believe in Him. He has given ...</answer>
        <answer>Because Russia practices religious freedom and does not blindly and ignorantly force everyone to convert to one religion or be punished. Faith is God which is forced is not really faith. The only God worth respect is one who allows man freedom of choice.</answer>
        <answer>i think its the same as why is USA a christia country and yet&lt;br&gt;  you have to pay for private schools--which are probablly supposed to be public&lt;br&gt;  and as people said before--it wasnt any choice of theirs</answer>

I know when you have bills coming in it is hard, I have 4 kids and only my husband works and aren't making it, but there is no way either of us could do it. we manage one day at a time. I agree to get a job if you can and see if that helps. Start cutting out things like cable, long dist. on the phone, eating out, just stuff like that can make a big difference.</answer>

      <detail>Jobs had his own money and success. So why did he have to bash Bill Gates? Just saw the '60 Minutes' piece with the author of a new book about Jobs, and found out some other things that I wasn't aware of. I was aware for years  of the beef that Jobs had with Gates, but didn't know some other things until watching the show, like how they said that "Jobs felt like rules didn't apply to him" (he had no drivers license, and would park in handicap spaces all the time and think nothing of it), and how he used to drop acid, and how he denied paternity and refused to pay child support for a baby that a girlfriend had. He just said "it's not mine" and walked away from any responsiblity. What I don't understand, is why so many people made him out to be some kinda god. He was just a man, nothing super human. So why couldn't Jobs just be happy for Gates, and go on with his life? (Gates did).  He also had a beef with 'Google' and bashed it too.  Seems like he hated competition.</detail>

      <answers>
        <answer>Do you mean that since somebody from your small town already got in, therefore MIT won't let you in just because they don't want two people from the same place?    Probably not a worry.  More likely they'll think that your high school has some great teachers.  Of course, schools always consider diversity at some point; they wouldn't want half their student body to come from one town!  (Granted, extremely unlikely.)  So at some point this issue does have an effect, but not at just two people.    ...</answer>
        <answer>it is still early, so you probably could.</answer>
        <answer>For the 07/08 school year?  You'd have to check their website for application deadlines, even those schools with rolling admissions deadlines those are coming up sometime in February.  If you're wanting to attend MIT, this is a decision that you really need to make your freshman year in high school, and prepare throughout your high school career to apply, and of course, have back up schools as well.  It's not a decision one makes on a whim at the end of the 1st semester of their senior year.  Th...</answer>
        <answer>well what age are you and did your friend use a fake name and depends how good of grades you have at your age and if she went to it and she's not lying  and the best part is you can get off earlier in life and start your love live and then you can be happily ever after and then get in a nice job and you will be a succesfull student you will be happy and then you will be a great mom and a  a great wife i know i dont know everything but the one thing is that i know is that you will be a succesful ...</answer>
        <answer>Acceptance at a school like MIT will depend on many factors.  Are you trying to gain entrance for year 2007 or later?    If you're trying for 9/07, you can still gain admittance if your grades and SAT scores are excellent.  Have you spoken to a high school guidance adviser about your situation?    Why not speak to your adviser, who best knows your specific situation?    Good luck!</answer>

      <title>Do you think Sonny Liston gave all he had against Cassius Clay?</title>
      <detail>Do you think he was doped up before the fight?  I just wondered because I saw Sonnys' documentary, video of that fight... just curious.</detail>
      <category>Sports;Boxing</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Yes.  He was just out classed by a big, tough, classy and very fast fighter.    The quote that Ali used was float like a butterfly sting like a bee.  The trouble was he hit a lot harder that a bee.  A fleet footed fast moving 200 lb + Ali contrary to popular belief hit very hard.  That's what confused him and frustrated him all night.  Its tough when your getting hit all the time and you have no answer for it.  Makes for a hard night.</answer>
        <answer>This is in regards to the "phantom" punch I beleive.   As Ali clearly misses before Sonny goes down.  If you watch just before that liss you will see Sonny get hit and it looks like he is on his way down before that punch that people point to.   Ali fought a long time after that and did pretty well,  Sonny was at the end of his career and it is always sad to see a fighter go out like that but that is the nature of the beast</answer>
        <answer>Liston was in mid 40's and had to dive to lose.</answer>
        <answer>No he did not give all he had and definitely not in the second fight.  People will probably start coming forward about this in the near future.  Liston was a much better fighter than who showed up in the ring against Ali.</answer>
        <answer>Doped up? No. Took a dive? Absolutely, and probably paid pretty well, too.</answer>

        <answer>I'm not sure about the retail cost in your area on a GST but you will destroy a GS engine at 8 psi. You'll need to rebuild it with better internals and you'll need more than 8 psi to get 200 hp from it.</answer>

I guess it is all in one's perspective because, while his image in most of the world is that of a ruthless, bloodthirsty conqueror, Genghis Khan is an iconic and beloved figure in Mongolia, where he is seen as the father of the Mongol Nation.</answer>

      <title>Who will win the heath care debate between Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott tomorrow ?</title>

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Abbott and the government of which he was part spent four terms taking every penny out of Medicare, the hospital system and other vital infrastructure to boost their 'budget surplus' and the false view of themselves as great fiscal managers.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  To my mind that's just the same as a miser who takes every penny and banks it while his family are sick and his roof is leaking.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The grind down in the basic services of this country which we, the taxpayers, fund was due in large part to...</answer>
        <answer>I don't think you can really call it a debate as the Liberals do not have a policy yet and Labor is drip feeding their policy bit by bit.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Personally I think it is poor form to have it in the middle of the day when most people are working.  Nevertheless I am going to watch it as I want to see if Rudd can explain an actual policy without resorting to spin.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  As for who will win I think Labor will get positive media coverage of the debate and be crowned the winner.</answer>
        <answer>I don't anticipate much substance to Abbott's debate. All he's done so far is accuse Rudd of being a policy ''fraud, fake and phoney'' when he himself hasn't released a single detailed costed policy.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Abbott is declining to be pinned down. He says he'll announce his policy detail when he's good and ready.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Which means he only has to defend general policy principles and make sweeping statements like ''there's no doubt we need to change our hospital system, but we need to make ...</answer>
        <answer>Tony Abbott will win &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  if it descends into a fist fight :-) &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I think Rudd will always win a battle of wits against the Mad Monk.</answer>
        <answer>Do you seriously have to ask such a question? Abbott is going to pwn Rudds *** away in the debate tomorrow.</answer>

This dude is so friendly to me...for instance, we talk online, and he's always insisting on helping me with homework, giving me music, rolling cigarettes for me.  but if i share something i think he'd like, like an artist, comedian or whatever, he'll ignore it...and other things like rolling a cigarette for him when he asked to bum one, weird him out and he gets distant.       what the hell? why would a person just want a one sided "friendship" of just giving, but rarely accepting from me?</detail>
      <category>Family &amp; Relationships;Friends</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Because he is getting something else from you.  You are making him feel good.  (I don't mean sex).  It is just being around you that he likes.  Maybe you laugh at his jokes that no one else gets.  Maybe you understand what he is talking about when no one else is willing to listen.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If you otherwise feel okay about this situation then I would suggest just enjoying the pampering.</answer>
        <answer>I know i dont let many people do nice things for me. He probably has self confidence issues and would rather give to you than take from you.</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>Insane Hal or Sane Hal? Surfer has the power... whatever it is called. He can destroy Earth with one shot. Hal  COULD destroy everything if he had the willpower... I don't think he has could do that. Destroy everything that ever was and ever will be? He wouldn't do that.     Surfer Vs. GL.... GL because Surfer could not understand what the Green Lantern goes through ever single second.</answer>
        <answer>silver surfer</answer>
        <answer>Surfer will just melt GL and surf on him.</answer>
        <answer>Two of my favorites!  No disrespect to Hal, but Silver Surfer would easily win this one sheerly based on the endurance factor, if nothing else.  The Surfer has the Power Cosmic, so he can go indefinitely without food, water, air, or sleep.  Hal Jordan's powers are centered in his ring, which must be recharged from time to time by his power battery.  Also, Hal still needs to eat, sleep, breathe, &amp; all the other things humans do.  In the end, the Surfer could just outlast him.</answer>

Next year, I plan on beginning to take powered flight lessons and getting my Private Pilot's Certification. My goal is to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in a few years, major in Aerospace Engineering, and serve as a Naval Aviator for around 8-10 years (the service obligation for an Aviator is eight or nine years), then transition into the U.S. Navy Reserve as a Lieutenant or Lieutenant Commander. Afterward, I would want to earn a graduate degree (Masters or Doctorate) in Aerospace Engineering, then becoming an aerospace engineer for Lockheed Martin, while serving as a Naval Aviator in the U.S. Navy Reserve. With that said, I was wondering, how much money does money do aerospace engineers for Lockheed Martin make?</detail>

      <title>What would Belize Lose if Guatemala was to close off it's diplomacy and boarders?</title>
      <detail>There has always been a dispute between Guatemala and Belize concerning an old treaty. Guatemala believes that Belize is theirs, but so far they have no proof of this. There will be a referendum in the two countries, and if the people vote yes, the matter will be taken to the International Court of Justice. If no, then there will be a serious conflict. I don't believe that Guatemala is dumb enough to start a war, but if they were to close all ties with Belize, what would Belizeans lose?</detail>

        <answer>Belize would lose nothing as their economy is driven by tourism and not trade with Guatemala...    But, some folks would miss an opportunity to travel from Amberguis Cay to Tikal which is a true shame!</answer>

      <title>Should I apply early action to  MIT?</title>
      <detail>I don't think you understand how much I love this school, so I'm trying to find the best ways to get in. I got a 1930 on my June SATS (kinda ok....)  and I will take bio and math 2 subj. tests in fall. Would you recommend applying early action?</detail>
      <category>Education &amp; Reference;Higher Education (University +)</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>In a word, No. You need at least 3 SAT II subjects for MIT, and besides a 1930 isn't MIT level. I mean come on, MIT is the number 6 school in the nation, and a 86% percentile ranking (meaning 140000 people at least) did better than you. You need AP's, advanced level Math and science courses (AP's) to get in. Have you done any math competitions (USAMO, USaPHo, Mandlebrot, USAMTS?) If you haven't, don't try to apply.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Applying to a college is one the most strenuous things in a high schoo...</answer>
        <answer>I wouldn't apply unless you have all the required information gathered. If you have that, there's no reason NOT to apply early.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I applied early and was deferred to regular admission, where I was accepted. Best of luck.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  *edit* I don't know what the dude above me is really talking about. 86th percentile does not mean that 140,000 people did better than you unless 1,000,000 people took the test.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I also don't know what he's talking about when he refers to bombing you...</answer>

      <title>Which practice round day is the best for the Pebble Beach U.S. Open?</title>
      <detail>I'm getting tickets for one day of the practice round for the 2010 US Open at Pebble Beach.  Which day, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday is the best day to go.  I really want to see Tiger play and I also hear that sometimes they have events like a Par-3 challenge.</detail>
      <category>Sports;Golf</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I went to the Monday and Wednesday practice rounds for the 2008 US open at Torrey Pines and I liked Monday better.  The reason for this is that I think there is less pressure as they are practicing.  If things are not going well on the practice range or the course, they still have 2 days to work the bugs out.  Also on Wednesday, I think the players quit earlier to get a good nights sleep.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Make sure to bring your camera on the practice days.  You can get pretty close and get some nic...</answer>
        <answer>i went to oakmont for the us open on monday and it wasnt crowded until the afternoon&lt;br&gt;  and also if you wanna see a lot of players without a lot of walking hang out at the range</answer>
        <answer>I'd say wednesday because Monday and Tuesday the golfers are probably just getting ready and warming up but on wednesday they're probably trying the hardest for practice.I dont know about when the par 3 challenge but if its on Tuesday deffinatly go then because the golfers probably go from warming up on monday to trying on wednesday so if its on tuesday go then.</answer>
        <answer>For the U.S. Open it really doesn't matter which practice round you go to as they will all be pretty much the same. Monday will probably be the least crowded of the three days. No Par 3 tournament at the U.S. Open, that is at The Masters only as they have a Par 3 course on the grounds.</answer>

      <title>Waiting Until Your Married To Have Sex? But Some People Are Just Awful In Bed....?</title>
      <detail>I am 20 years old and have been in a few relationships, one total long term serious relationship.      Now I am not a relationship Dr. but I have started to figure out the basics, after 1.5-2 years the "spark" wears off and if you have been having sex, it is interesting but not that interesting especially if your living together - which can lead the other person to thinking your not into them anymore.      I would like to try and hold off on having sex with my next serious significant other as long as possible as I see it can break relationships quickly and give the wrong and mixed feelings.  I have become a christian in the last 6 months and the bible says in 1 Corinthians 7:1-5 that Satan will tempt with sexual temptation and your control over it.  In scripture it also says a man and a women who are not related should not live together as it presents evil.      Reading over just about every single forum post or anything it says good and great sex is key to a a successful happy marriage.  Now from my prior days there are women who are extremely attractive, have great chemistry, but are horrible in bed - or just to say we are not compatible in the bed.  And on the flip side there are other women who are great in bed.      Because I have been sexually active in my life I have something to compare my future wife to while in bed.  How do you wait until marriage to have sex and have a great sexual relationship?  I have before been in love with a girl and making love to her was not a complete turn on and I am concerned about waiting until marriage because at that point I found an attractive girl, we had a good amount of chemistry and when we finally got in bed, things started to go down hill...... You hear out of every non christian "try before you buy"      And also, there are some people you just absolutely can not live together with, yes it takes work but my gosh!</detail>

        <answer>I don't see your question here -&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I was a virgin up to my wedding night - I was 26 and married my high school sweetheart - he too was a virgin at the age of 28&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I never regretted my decision in waiting - unfortunately he passed away 4yrs into our marriage&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  We enjoyed learning from each other as we went along -&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Marriage isn't all about sex -</answer>
        <answer>Good sex contributes to a good marriage, but marriage is not about sex.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Think about it - in your lifetime - how much time per day will you actually spend having sex?  Not that much.  All of the other time will be spent living life with your spouse - I would focus on the personality and attitude of the potential spouse.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Someone who has never had sex or who is bad at it can improve with a patient teacher.

She will be more than glad to sign your copy; that’s what she’s there for. You simply tell her what you’d like her to say. Some authors just sign the book.

        <answer>you spit on it and rub it with sea turtle. and hey Answer your phone please :) love ya!</answer>
        <answer>I don't know much about the car you have, but Jaguars normally have good speaker systems (some even have B&amp;W speakers!).  That in mind, I'm guessing it comes with a 6" sub or two?  Just a guess.  Point being if you can't figure it out on your own, I wouldn't try it myself.  Especially since subs are normally under lots of other important car parts and more than your speaker system can get damaged.  I would take it to a professional to get it fixed or someone who knows what they're doing.  Often ...</answer>
        <answer>Jaguars are very finicky kind of cars, you best bet would be to call the dealer in the morning and explain the situation, they should be able to give you a rough explanation about how to remove the sub and replace it.  I suspect there will be alot more than just removing trimming if I know Jaguars, and repoed enough of them to know they are THOROUGHLY a pain in the A$$ to work on.</answer>

      <title>Why are the greens at Pebble Beach spotted?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Sports;Golf</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>It is the type of grass that are on the greens called Poa Anna and it is a cool weather damp condition type of grass that grows fast.In the Summer it usually dies out.</answer>
        <answer>asked and answer three times in the last two days</answer>
        <answer>It has something to do with the course being so close to the ocean. You might have noticed that the greens closer to the ocean are more spotted. But more specifically I think it is either the dirt the greens are on or the air which might have salt in it</answer>
        <answer>Primarily because of Pebble being a seaside course, as greens on seaside courses typically look spotchy like that from the salt they're exposed to. Between that, and the lack of water and rolling the greens and cutting them tight for the U.S. Open, and the invasive poa anna taking over the Bermuda - and the fact that things look so sharpe now that they're filmed with HD cameras - and you're left with greens that look worse than they are.</answer>

        <answer>Because liberals don't understand what they mean. Integrity is a word that simply confuses them. Family values is taking money from your family and spending it on worthless projects.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  They do understand taxing and taxing some more. They love growing government which necessitates more taxes. And they are experts at giving your money away to countries that hate us and paying the UN to insult us. Of course Obama did that all by himself too.</answer>

        <answer>Cape Breton Island is just off the north east coast of Nova Scotia.  It is separated from the mainland by the Strait of Canso.  The Canso Causeway which is just under a mile long joins Cape Breton to the rest of Nova Scotia.    PEI is the next closest province and is separated from Cape Breton Island by the Northumberland Strait. There is about 40 miles separating the two.    Cape Breton to Newfoundland across the Cabot Strait is further. The distance between the two is 60 miles or so.</answer>

This is a way to tell you when inventory needs to be ordered.  I like the two bin system, so as to when I have one bin empty I know its time to order parts from stock to fill the second one, never running out of parts, but also never being overstocked.

        <answer>Minimal inventory of parts.  Thus saving storage and insurance and reducing theft.    Strong relationship with suppliers.  Suppliers need to be responsive to changes in production levels.  They must be reliable and flexible.    Some supplier have the ability to provide inputs in the order in which the input would go into the production process.  This saves a lot of time and is very efficient.

The Bible has been edited repeatedly and translated from language to language (losing original meaning each time).

        <answer>You can still travel to Thailand, it's only an advisory, I have not hear of any flights being canceled.  The airport is open for business as normal.  And yes your travel insurance will not cover the political unrest.  This happened to many people during the airport shut down in Dec, many were upset because travel insurance did not cover riots.</answer>
        <answer>It's advice not an order.They cannot stop people from going there.You would need to check the  small print in the policy but any claim linked to the disturbances would be invalid.Main airport is closed presently though.</answer>
        <answer>Yes it means you still can. Try flying into Phuket or Chiang Mai instead if you are concerned. These cities have been largely unaffected by the issues in Bangkok.</answer>

"""Sunday, June 22, 2008  One Hundred Years of Old Age Pensions       Here's my article to mark the centenary of old age pensions, from the Daily Express. And if, like me, you think it's about time that Britain's political elite gave our OAPs the fair deal they deserve, then please lend your support, in whatever way you can to the National Pensioners Convention. The key hallmark of a civilied society is how it treats its old folk-and by that measure Britain, with the lowest state pension in the EU, is failing badly.     It has been described as the most momentous date in British social history, the day on which the modern welfare state was born. One hundred years ago (on 7th May 1908), Prime Minister Herbert Asquith announced his governments intention to introduce an Old Age Pensions bill. For the first time in British history, the elderly would receive a pension from the state.     The idea of a universal old-age pension, payable to all elderly people as of right, was first raised in the French Revolution of 178999. It was however, to be another hundred years before Germany became the first country in the world to introduce pensions.    A further nine countries followed Germanys lead, before the British government finally decided it was time to act.    With improvements in medical knowledge, people were living longer than ever before. Yet there was no state provision for old age. In 1906, almost 20% of the population over 65 were officially classed as paupers. Women fared particularly badly; around three-quarters of the recipients of outdoor relief were elderly women. Old people who could not rely on the kindness of relatives to look after them often ended their days in the dreaded workhouse (pictured above). By the end of the Victorian period the largest group of workhouse inmates were the elderly.     Workhouse life was made as harsh and humiliating as possible, so that the able-bodied poor would apply for relief only as a last resort. But while the system was designed to discourage the work-shy, it also meant that the elderly, through no fault of their own, were also penalised. Aged pauper couples were not allowed to share a bedroom. Workhouse inmates had their clothes confiscated and were forced to wear uniform akin to prisoners. Many suffered from malnutrition: hardly surprising considering that the standard dinner was 6oz of bread and 2oz of cheese.    The scandalous treatment of the elderly in what was then the richest country on earth led to growing calls for state intervention. In 1891, the philanthropist Charles Booth published his first old-age pensions proposals. In 1899, a Parliamentary select committee investigated and advocated non-contributory old age pensions. In 1902, a campaign group called the National Committee of Organised Labour on Old Age Pensions was formed; its founder George Barnes, defeated the Conservative Cabinet minister Andrew Bonar Law in the 1906 general election.     The fiery Welsh Liberal Party politician Lloyd George, who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1908, had long advocated old age pensions and was determined to take action that, in his own words, would "lift the shadow of the workhouse from the homes of the poor". But though his Old Age Pensions Act was groundbreaking, its provisions could not be described as over-generous. A pension of up to 5s (25p) per week would be paid to single men and women only when they reached the age of 70; married couples were to receive about 7s6d (35p). The pensions, although non-contributory were means tested: anyone over 70 who had some form of income had this deducted from their pension. Only British subjects resident in the country for twenty years were eligible, anyone who had been in receipt of poor relief in the last twelve months or in prison within the previous ten years was barred. In addition, pensions were not available to those who were deemed to have habitually failed to work according to their ability, opportunity and need.     As limited as the provisions were, Lloyd Georges proposals were for some, the thin end of the wedge. Old age pensions would prove profoundly demoralising and would weaken the moral fibre of the nation, critics like the Tory peer Lord Robert Cecil claimed.     But the governments scheme proved hugely popular. The cry God bless that Lord George was heard across the country when the</detail>

      <title>How do you inform the NIH, the CDC, &amp; the ADA they made a mistake about the so-called benefits of fluoride?</title>
      <detail>The apparent benefit of water fluoridation, reduced tooth decay, may simply be a function of delayed tooth eruption, Limeback said. It is well-known that permanent teeth take longer to erupt in children who drink fluoridated water, he observed. Studies comparing decay rates in fluoridated and nonfluoridated communities usually assess the mean number of decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (DMFS) in permanent teeth of 12-year-old children. For example, a study conducted in 1990 found that 12-year-old children in fluoridated areas of the U.S. had a mean DMFS score of 2.46, while those in nonfluoridated areas had a score of 2.97 ( J. Dental Res. 1990, 69 Special Issue, 723). However, "if you control for delayed tooth eruption, the study shows no benefit,"   H. Trendley Dean, DDS, ("father of fluoridation"), the original promoter of water fluoridation as an effective tool in fighting dental decay, admitted over 60 years ago under oath, that his evidence purporting to prove the fluoridation hypothesis﻿ was NOT valid.  (H. Trendley Dean: Proceedings, City of Oroville vs. Public Utilities Commission of the State of California, Oroville, California, Oroville, California, October 20-21, 1955.)... also... (See 4-1: "Fluoridation Benefits - Statistical﻿ Illusion." Testimony of Konstantin K. Paluev, Research and Development Engineer, Mar. 6, 1957).  Trendley Dean admitted under oath on﻿ a witness stand that his early data gave ZERO evidence that increasing fluoride concentration in the water supply reduced tooth decay. To paraphrase Dean's findings, "As children's teeth disintegrate, they may have fewer cavities".</detail>

      <title>Where can I find a copy of La Belle et La Bête in Paris?</title>
      <detail>I am going to Paris next April and my friend wants a french copy of this book in french. Are there any bookstores who carry this book often so that I have a chance to buy it?</detail>
      <category>Travel;France;Paris</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Any bookstore such as FNAC would have it in stock in the children's section. It actually is not always sold under the title "La Belle et La Bête" though, but under "Contes de Fées" par Charles Perrault, the author, as it is part of several  fairy tales that include Cendrillon, Barbe Bleue, Peau d'Ane, Le petit Chaperon rouge and  several other short stories which are less well known in English speaking countries. Antiquarians on the banks of the Seine might even have an interesting old copy or a...</answer>
        <answer>Hi,&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  You'll probably find it easily at the Gilbert Joseph library, address:&lt;br&gt;  26-34, boulevard Saint Michel&lt;br&gt;  75006 Paris . &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  They have a wide range of books for all categories including children and youth. I lived in Paris for one year and whenever I was looking for a very specific book, I would go there because they seem to have it all. Bonus point: they also sell second hand books, which isn't the case for other retailers, so you could get your copy at knock-down pri...</answer>
        <answer>Wise Owl has given you the correct author's name and the alternative title of the book and as said, there is no need to run around Paris to find a specific bookshop. All bookshops stock Perrault because it is part of France's  cultural heritage and routinely read as bedtime stories to children. Those fairy tales are as popular as Hans Christian Andersen's. You will find it not only bookshops but supermarkets, and even some newsagents, and you can buy it for a song on the internet immediately if ...</answer>

In our epoch, you might just catch a glimpse from Eilat of the star Gacrux, the northernmost star of the cross, hanging low over the Gulf of Aqaba.  The rest of the constellation is too far south, although in theory three of the four should break the plane of the astronomical horizon from Israel's most southerly city.

If he did go, he would have been shielded from combat. His role would be to improve the moral of those actually dying. Ali knew this.

        <answer>My bubble is not busted at all. Civil disobedience has been used for centuries to fight unjust policies. The United States has forgotten that the Constitution is our law. The Constitution  gives the right to start wars to the Congress, but since World War II, the presidents think they have the right to start wars.

      <title>Vampires... Real? Fake? People who want to believe so much that they drink human blood?</title>
      <detail>1) I have never watched/read twilight. 2) I recently found some books in my attic, They are Diaries from 1652 and writen by a woman ( no name will be given) she talks about a new man in town and she thinks there is something strang about him. She states this "He has bright blue eye's but he is a lighter to the skin then the other men... he looked at me with eye's of hunger and agression." This is all I would like to say at the moment about this diary. But I read a little more and she starts talking about how she got to know him and she later says he told her he was a vampire and he had to leave so no harm would come to her. Say I'm making this up... I do not care but I was not a believer before I read this book. And this is a serious question. DO VAMPIRE'S EXCIST! Now I understand if you are a vampire and you answer saying " vampires are nothing like you see in the movies". But what if they was? And to the people that comment saying " omg vampires don't excist get over it" Don't. I can believe what I want and you should respect that. Anyway the question is. If you are a REAL vampire please answer this and let me ask you some question's. NO TWILIGHT VAMP WANNA BE'S PLEASE. I want to hear off a real one. So if I get no answer I will know that vampires do not spend there lives on a computer :P but i will still believe. This has made me think what could be real</detail>

        <answer>Nice story about the diary collection, but you're full of crap.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, anyone educated enough to keep a journal in 1652 would have been educated in things like spelling - and you're not.  Second, an authentic series of diaries from from the 1600's would be worth a lot of money and (third) not worth sitting there and reading looking for vampire references.  Even a 13 year old kid would know that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yes, I'll say you're making this up.  Thanks for listing it amongst the options!</answer>
        <answer>So i don't know if Vampires are fake or real, because I don't have proof on either side. However, I was in NYC with a friend for a vacation, and we were walking and this guy comes up to us and starts talking, so I think this guy is drunk, because he says "I will create a world of only Vampires, and I will be king!" Then he grabs my wrist and bits it like super hard, then runs away like a phyco! We didn't report it or anything, but he left a faint scar, but vivid enough to see. &lt;br&gt;I do feel diff...</answer>
        <answer>I believe the vampire thing I've had it drilled into my head since I could remember....because I have Transylvanian heritage from the turn of the century and frankly I want to read those journals like REALLY bad. Vampires, werewolves, and ghosts are real but because of so much controversy I can not tell you what to do defined, but if I were you I would try to find a person that looks similar to the description and randomly say his name and see what happens....cool story for really...</answer>
        <answer>Vampires are 100% fake.&lt;br&gt;Vampires do not exist.&lt;br&gt;Never have, never will.&lt;br&gt;Biologically and genetically impossible for a human being changing into another species.</answer>

      <detail>It's bizarre. Somehow, it's demeaning to humans to suggest that we have some common simian ancestor, but it's not demeaning to suggest that lusting after a beautiful woman is a perfectly good reason to torture someone by burning them alive forever?</detail>
      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Religion &amp; Spirituality</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Because whenever they think of hell they imagine that everyone else is going to it. But evolution means that we are all on equal terms and they aren't part of God's favorite group. Their morality only extends within their own social circle, but evolution means the same rules apply to everybody.</answer>
        <answer>Never said I wasn't appalled at the notion of hell. I am also appalled at the people denying their Creator, abortion, rape and sin. All those things and many more things are appalling.&lt;br&gt;Blessed be to us that God made an escape to save us from hell if you're not too mentally incapacitated/foolishly prideful/obstinately blinded to accept it.</answer>

      <category>Travel;Latin America;Guatemala</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Your dog has to be quarrantined in one location for about 90 days (if he's in your house the whole time that counts).  You then have to take the dog to a vet and have a form filled out that certifies all the proper vaccinations have been provided.  I seem to also remember having to get a certification from the Guatemalan Consulate in the US.  It's a big mess.  It's possible, but probably not worth it in your situation.</answer>
        <answer>They make it FAR more complicated than most countries...which is a message that they are already overrun with dogs and don't really want more brought in.  See site below for regulations.</answer>

        <answer>Well when the Un stops hamas from using tier UN compounds as cover to attack israel.    We all remember the UN got caught lying about letting hezzbollah use UN outpost as cover to attack israel in 2006.    Luckly the canadian Maj.

        <answer>The simple truth is that the Zionists just don't really give a crap what any other country thinks about what they do because they have been given carte blanche thus far to do whatever it takes to survive because the whole world feels guilty about what the Jews suffered in WW2 and nobody has called them on their crap and the US just uses them as their only ally in the middle east.

        <answer>It isn't possible to be paid via PayPal with Adsense. You could try a different ad network such as Adwager as they have PayPal as a payout option. The pay is good and their ads can be displayed side by side with Adsense as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://adwager.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://adwager.com&lt;/a&gt;</answer>
        <answer>No you can't send AdSense money to your paypal. If you are in USA or Canada then you can do a wire transfer your earning to your bank account but I think AdSense take off $25 for that. So requesting a check is the best option.</answer>

      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Holidays;Ramadan</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Ideally none of the Prophets should be drawn or have an image made of them. Unfortunately there is not really a lot that you can do about the whole Jesus (pbuh) situation because it is so common so is considered the norm.</answer>
        <answer>I do get offended, it is not allowed. But in christianity they have pictures of him everywhere, even in churches so there is nothing we can do about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the way Isa (pbuh) was not white and does not look anything like the way christians portray him&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;@nexi - When I mean white I'm talking about pale white.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;@nexi - Learn to read, reddish-white is not the white skin Europeans/Westerners have.

        <answer>If a common dictator like sadam Hussein,Idi Amin,stalin,prophet Muhammed,poli pot et.c would get angry at people criticising him or even drawing their cartoons in say a local news paper then what would be the diffrence btn these people and Allah the emotional &amp; irrational version of the muslim god who needs muslims to kill for him because of muhammed pictures as he cant?Do muslims worship satan who hates any form of criticism-Then how should we normal people behave if our God is like that?</answer>
        <answer>Each is as bad as the other and neither should be drawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may however be shocked to learn that Jesus [pbuh] was not white European as in paintings so in fact he has not been drawn.&lt;br&gt;And neither was he nailed on a bit of wood either .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually there are old  pictures of Muhammad pbuh in existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People are not supposed to create pictures of living things , any at all ! the danger is that people worship the image as is often displayed by idolaters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have not see...</answer>

      <title>Is The Congress Party Deliberately Keeping The Masses Illiterate In Order To Stay In Power???</title>
      <detail>When an individual develops the skill to read and write, they have concomitantly developed an ability to utilise logic and reason, comprehend information, critically analyse and question the information that they receive. Whether it is what they are reading, what they are being told or what they visually see in front of their eyes.    Many Indians are not capable of learning from their mistakes or of learning from history, due to rampant illiteracy, and thus there is present an inability of Indians to employ their powers of intellect. Had there been a high level of literacy in India, many indians would be able to fathom that the communist founding fathers are responsible for the majority of the national security problems India is facing and that the Congress party, along with its plague of leftists, secularists and communists have single handedly destroyed the country for over 50 years. In this respect, rampant illiteracy works in favour of the dirty communists in maintaining power.</detail>

        <answer>To my friend John above, the Turkish Empire never existed. However the Ottoman Empire did, and it was the only empire that provided a haven for the Jews when they were exiled from Spain. Also  don't forget the exile of Jews from Britain. In answer to your question, I don't think the Jewish MPs you have listed had a great deal to do with Israel's occupation in the Palestine Mandate by that time. Israel's beginnings however, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, saw the British army become...</answer>
        <answer>No. Your Zionist conspiracy theory, if that's what it is, is not borne out by the facts. We have had a Jewish Prime Minister (Disraeli) but he was not able to influence the situation in what was then the Ottoman Empire. Evangelical figures like Lord Shaftesbury was probably more of a champion of Israel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Israel has relied far more on the USA (the first country to recognise the State of Israel) than anything the bankrupt post-war British Government has been able to do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Thatcher...</answer>
        <answer>Frankly, no.  The British government had bigger things to think about in general, such as Irish terrorism and the Cold War.  Indeed the Middle East is always a thorn in the flesh of all western governments.  Though Israel does indeed oppress Palestinians, Jews in general have as much historical right to a presence the Middle East as Palestinians - both groups have ties to that area going back thousands of years.   Would you care to try to prove otherwise?   Just be thankful that neither the Assy...</answer>

      <title>What Turns People away from Christianity in your opinions (I AM a Christian just curious)?</title>
      <detail>I'm a Christian, I've heard alot of reasons why people won't come to Christianity.  1. Hypocrites  I've been asked Why doesn't God show himself to us? I'll answer that right away so I'm not called out on it. Ok imagine you're walking down the street, the skies open up and a God appears up in the clouds and tells you to worship him, you probably would because you can SEE him, he wants us to follow him because we want to and have faith in him. I've been asked Why didn't God make us all obedient to him? Simple answer to that, Do you want someone to worship you because they WANT to or HAVE to?    I'm finished there, so what are your biggest turn offs about Christianity, supply proof if counteracting with "science" or something else, if it's a general statement ya know just say it.    and if you wanna discuss with me tell me and I'll add you to contacts.</detail>

      <detail>Okay, so I landed a teaching job in Guatemala, for summer vacation. I'm going to be teaching English for a month and half, and I want to make this teaching experience memorable for both the students and I. I'm asking this question because I know the kids in Guatemala are very poor and I want them to have the proper materials for my class, I don't want them to HAVE to buy them for a class that they would only be taking for a short time.   Btw, I'm 15, and I am not volunteering in an organization, my daddy got me the job and I'm going to work in an actual school.</detail>
      <category>Travel;Latin America;Guatemala</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The answer is a complete yes! But if you wanna save some money I recommend to buy the supplies in Guatemala as well. Also, you don't need to buy fancy supplies, but tons of supplies, for them quantity is better than fancy stuff, because they will be able to use them for longer period of time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, thank you for doing it. As a Guatemalan, I hope you had a wonderful experience here. God bless you.</answer>
        <answer>Yes,you should definitely bring school supplies. The kids there don't have very much and would just LOVE for you to give them something. Just imagine their cute little faces when they receive a gift. I used to have an English teacher who would go to Nicaragua every year and bring school supplies and soccer equipment, and he would always tell us that poor kids in Central America love receiving school supplies and soccer equipment. You can maybe also bring soccer equipment too, if you have any use...</answer>

      <title>Google Chrome and Internet explorer keeps crashing?</title>
      <detail>I'm a Windows Vista user and Every time I open google chrome or Internet explorer they instantly crash, I get a note saying data execution prevention has closed them. However both work perfectly fine in safe mode, and Firefox works most of the time but sometimes crashes. I have Microsoft security essentials and I have run a number of full system scans with nothing detected. I prefer to use google chrome and was happily using it for years until suddenly one day this issue started. Any suggestions are appreciated</detail>

        <answer>Any computer in the world can be used for taking notes. You've got nothing to worry about. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Hell, I can use my calculator to type out plaintext documents. It doesn't take much processing power at all.</answer>
        <answer>I think you mean a netbook, which is a small laptop. Yes, you can do essays on them, that and web browsing is basically all that they're good for given that their specs aren't that great.</answer>
        <answer>If you are getting a netbook as opposed to laptop, firstly bear in mind that a lot of them run linux rather than Microsoft OS and also not all of them have a cd drive which means if software isn't pre-loaded you won't be able to put any of your own software on but will have to rely on downloading from internet.

      <title>Drinking Laws in Turkey, Dalyan?</title>
      <detail>Hi, my parents are taking me, my 17 year old brother and my best friend to Turkey, Dalyan for 2 weeks in August. We have a villa in town so me and my friend can go out at night. We will be 15 when we go there (yes yes i know we're young) and we are very mature for our age. My mum lets me have the occasional drink as she knows i know my limits and would not be stupid and take advantage of the trust she has in me.   So, my question is would me and my friend get served in Dalyan in bars or convenience shops? - what is the laws for drinking there - would they be able to tell if i an ID used was fake (if i get one)  -and what are the punishments?  Please no irrelevant responses.  Thanks for reading.  Good answers are appreciated. :)</detail>

        <answer>Umm, as I usually travel in the southern Turkey, I assume you would not have any problems. If you wear your make-up stuff you probably look older enough as many girls do. &lt;br&gt;However, things may change if you try to get in to a ''posh'' clubs. These places may want to check your passport.&lt;br&gt;There is no punishment for you to drink, the law applies to the seller however they can serve you alcohol if you are with an adult or with your parents, this is legal.&lt;br&gt;But afterall, Dalyan is a touristic ...</answer>
        <answer>you might not get shopped at shops if you are not with your parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the laws says it's forbidden to sell drinks or cigarettes to people below 18. but noone really takes the laws seriously, especially at touristic places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;there is no punishment for drinking or smoking. The punishment would apply to the seller. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;i wouldnt recommend to go for a fake id, because that is against the law and might put you into trouble if it's found out.</answer>
        <answer>Legal drinking age is 18. Don't even try, they will get you.</answer>
        <answer>If the bartender can see u are under 18 he will ask for id.&lt;br&gt;but mostly is it not a problem</answer>

        <answer>I have a solution for you: Make your own healthy milkshake and stop feeling guilty when you drink it.    Buy a small container of chocolate whey protein powder (Optimum Nutrition 100% whey in double rich chocolate flavor is very good) and mix one or two scoops of the powder with a cup of skim milk, and some ice cubes in a blender. Add additional ice until you get it to the consistency that you are looking for. You can also blend in some natural peanut butter, bananas or add some vanilla, almond ...</answer>
        <answer>It's perfectly fine. I prefer the large Jamocha shakes from Arby's.</answer>
        <answer>What are ya, pregnant? My pregnant relatives all have milkshake obsessions!</answer>
        <answer>Quench your addiction. Just kidding.  Most soft drinks have caffine in them, and caffine is an addicting. Check if your milkshakes have caffine or any other addictant in them. When you stop consuming caffine, there is one point where you think that you NEED caffine (or other addictant). Wait through that and it'll cure your obsession.  I have no idea why I just wrote that, because milkshakes don't have caffine in them. I guess I just want to post somthing.</answer>
        <answer>Maybe your body is trying to tell you that you are low on calcium. This is a very common phenomenon; we tend to crave the foods that are high in whatever vitamin or mineral we need.</answer>

Maybe from distance, but from everywhere else... not so much. Jordan had a higher FT and FG%, with a deadly midrange/post game that would shame Kobe.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  And how about in crunch time: Well after some rough early years, Jordan essentially went 6/6 when he finally got it going.

        <answer>It depends on your goals...both long term and short term.  If you are considering majoring in engineering, I would opt for MIT however, if you are planning on pursuing an advanced degree in engineering, you should look into MIT's rules.  Many graduate departments at MIT do not accept their own undergrads in their graduate programs.  If you are considering going for your Phd, then maybe Princeton would be the better alternative.  This would allow you to earn your doctorate at MIT whereas, if you ...</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>He is not in the same league. Remember he is only half black besides. I seriously doubt that Obama was ridiculed like Rosa Parks. He certainly does not follow MLK's belief. The proof in that is the church he attended for 20 years. Talk about a totally racist church, and yes he knew it was racists. He choose to go there up until he started to run for president. Even Oprah stopped going there after a few times. He uses his race as a plus to get what he wants. Why else would he call himself the bla...</answer>
        <answer>It is not an insult to anyone.  Obama has become the first black president of the United States.  That is quite an accomplishment, so he deserves to be mentioned in the same league as the others.</answer>
        <answer>No. But I find this question a bit insulting. Obama will become the 44th president - up until this moment all 43 presidents before him have been white. So he's definitely very extraordinary in that sense. I think Martin and Rosa would feel just as proud of him as everybody who voted for him. Most of the world wanted Obama to win, that's not really something that has ever happened before. As for saying he's not really done much, give him a chance - Bush hasn't moved out of the White House yet. lo...</answer>
        <answer>I think the fact that Obama didn't have to suffer the same indignities does make a significant diffference, but the fact still remains that Obama represents a wonderful development in our culture!  </answer>

People basically discovered that they can buy stocks with borrowed money, and the market got flooded with this borrowed money. Once the borrowed money couldnt be delivered back to the creditor, the market started to collapse under itself...</answer>

      <title>Can someone explain the whole CIA and drug distribution thing?</title>
      <detail>I don't understand what people are referring to when they talk about the CIA being drug dealers/distributors or saying they work with drug dealers.  If you could also explain the FBI working with "organized crime" thing too.  Thanks</detail>

      <answers>
        <answer>These things happened in the past. They probably aren't happening now, but if they were it would be classified/top secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why? because illegal drugs are a great way to raise untraceable money for operations. The CIA is supposed to tell Congress what it's doing and Congress approves it and funds it. But what if they wanted to do a job off the record? See the Iran-Contra affair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_and_Contras_cocaine_trafficking_in_the_US" rel="nofollow"&gt;http:...</answer>
        <answer>It's largely rumor exagerrated by jackasses who live in basements with no real proof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is what it usually comes down to.  The CIA has contacts with any number of shady individuals.  If you're going to hire someone to smuggle guns, odds are he does something else in the off season, like smuggle drugs.</answer>
        <answer>The CIA and FBI are the most cleanest Law enforcement agencies in the world.Rest whatever is said about them are just lies.They are here to end crime not encourage it.</answer>

        <answer>Oh jeeze, you should always use every opportunity to wear your dirndl!   I highly doubt you will be the only one there wearing one.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The only reason you might be in the minority is if the event is a tourist heavy one.   Not many tourists are willing to make the investment in a dirndl, but you can count on them appreciating the fact that you're wearing one.</answer>

        <answer>JIT stands for Just-In-Time compilation, sort of a middle ground between compiling and interpreting.  A compiler makes numerous passes through a system and optimizes it, while an interpreter executes one line at a time in sequence.  In JIT, the source code is first translated into an intermediate form called a bytecode.  The bytecode is not the native machine code of the platform, but a platform-independent intermediary.  The heavy-lifting of optimizing the code is done during the translation in...</answer>
        <answer>JIT-Just In Time compilation  Its not only in java but also in dot net.    Previously, all the things whether it is necessary for the current operation will be everytime compiled and loaded regardless of the changes.    But in JIT compilation, watever functions necessary will be loaded in the memory and the those functions will be compiled only when there is a change in a particular function and reload it in the memory.    This is the use of JIT compilation</answer>

        <answer>Make sure the dogs aren't allowed in the yard by themselves....better yet, keep them on leash as owl can be extremely fast when they fly down to get their prey</answer>
        <answer>No. It is not safe to let your little dog outside unsupervised. Owls regular prey are skunks but they can easily carry off a small dog. I know this because, I had a friend with a rather large overweight cat. The cat was walking around their yard and was taken by an Owl. She never saw the cat again. Don't chance it.  &lt;br&gt;As for your Golden Doodle. It depends on the size and weight of the dog. If it is a miniature, do not let him alone in the yard. If it is a medium or standard size dog, he will b...</answer>
        <answer>If you make a lot of noise it may make it fly away and rethink coming back. Owls have enough sense to avoid danger and will not stay where they feel threatened.  Other than that call Animal Control. Until then keep your Golden Retriever x Poodle mix (NOT Goldendoodle) inside and do not allow the dog outside to play with its teddy bears unsupervised.</answer>

        <answer>Don't leave the little dog outside unattended. Take him outside on leash to relieve himself &amp; stay with him until he is done &amp; then bring him inside. The larger dog would be too big for an owl to mess with.</answer>

      <title>Stock investing website?</title>
      <detail>I found this website the other day, and I can't find it again. It has a list of tons of stocks and next to each, it had the price, percentage it went up, and then it had if you should buy or sell the stock. The list was huge, and now I can't find it. Does anybody know what this is or something similar?  P.S. This is for a game for my civics class, so I'm not actually buying stocks like this.</detail>

        <answer>1.  Stocks are bought and sold from the Stock Exchganges, through the websites of stockbrokers .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.  However, there are 'Stock Investment Websites' which give  Stock Information.  There are many such sites. However, investors would do well to stay with several widely used and trusted sites for their main information and research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ehow.com/stock-investment-websites/http://www.ehow.com/list_7154266_comprehensive-websites-stock-information.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http...</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>Genghis destroyed,Michelangelo created.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; What did Genghis leave behind for today's world? Nothing.&lt;br&gt; From Michelangelo we have the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,his statue of David,and many other works to marvel at and enjoy.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Edit:&lt;br&gt; Russia,the Middle East and much of China were all conquered by the Mongols AFTER Genghis Khan died. His influence on them was therefore zero.</answer>
        <answer>That's a tough one, because Genghis was WAY more influential... His impact on China, Russia and the Middle East was immense.  Michelangelo was a great artist, but his art did not change the course of history for hundreds of millions of people.  I somewhat agree with the previous answer that you could argue Michelangelo's works are still widely known, while Genghis has no influence today outside of Mongolia.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Karl Marx died before the Russian Revolution, so I guess his influence on Russia...</answer>

        <answer>From the stacktrace, guessing at how your internal software works from the method names, I'd guess your internal library (com.schneker.common.model.Logging) is attempting to create a log file and can't. Keep in mind that default File creation in Java doesn't create sub directories, so if you've specified a logging directory in web.xml be sure the entire path exists.     Creating/changing directories in UNIX is the same as in Windows: cd to change directories, mkdir to create new ones.    Without...</answer>
        <answer>I think the stacktrace reveals the fault with the first line (which is unusual) it can't resolve the file and then cascades the rest of the errors. Two things, you moved the location of your project. File permissions can hamper assert true ==  myFile.isFile();    Intriguing, you think java jobs are out there. I guess you got to be under 30.</answer>

      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography</category>

        <answer>When you got your mobile, you should have got an adapter supplied with it. (I did.)&lt;br&gt;Place your Mini mmc into adapter, then place adapter into the appropriate slot (sd/mmc) on your PC/Laptop.&lt;br&gt;Then copy/move your pics from the card to a folder on your desktop.&lt;br&gt;If you do not have any card slots on your PC, buy a Card reader. Cheap from ebay or 7 day shop.</answer>
        <answer>Try taking it to Walmart or another department store and use the kiosks in their photo departments. They take several types of memory cards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;edit-If it is a micro, then you will probably need an adapter for it before you can use it. If you can't find the adapter that should have come with it, then you can buy one at Walmart for about $10-15. It will come with another micro card and maybe an extra adapter. If the photos are worth printing you will just have to buy the adapter.</answer>
        <answer>I looked up your phone and there is no mention of a memory card or what kind of card it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have to know if it is a xD, Memory Stick, Micro SD or whatever before we can begin to give you a cogent answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may just have to email them to yourself and then transfer them to a USB  thumb drive</answer>

      <detail>So, I'm not catholic, and I don't believe in the Vatican. But I go to a catholic school, and why don't the vatican tell us that St.Peter is a rabbit. Why don't they show him as a rabbit in the Last Supper portrait. I bet if the Mona Lisa, was a man, they'll tell that, but this is a secret of Christianity and I personally, that's just wrong. After the people found that, no one would have faith in the Vatican. A man can't be the voice of all the catholics, and shown as ignorant. Rabbits are pure and they possibly have the best interest.

      <title>LGBT: Did anyone even know who Harvey Milk was before the recent film?</title>
      <detail>This question is more applicable to the younger generation, but I’m sure older folks can relate to the point I’m trying to make. So many of our supporters and advocates for LGBT rights seem so passionate about LGBT issues (gay marriage, Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, etc.), but why do we know so little about LGBT history?      Does it really take making a movie to get people to acknowledge the contributions people have made to our movement? Harvey Milk obviously made significant contributions and influenced the rights we have today, but I don’t recall ever hearing anyone even say his name before the movie was in production. Now, all of a sudden, I see a bunch of younger people saying things like “Milk is the LGBT MLK”. There are so many other activists out there that have done so much for us, but we don’t even seem to know their names.       Examples:   → Dr. Frank Kameny: He organized, along with others, the first public demonstration in favor of gay rights in front of the White House. He started the campaign to get rid of sodomy laws, and he was one of the speakers that persuaded the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. He was the first openly gay person to run for a position in the US Congress.    → Del Martin &amp; Phyllis Lyon: Along with others, they founded the first national organization for lesbians in the US. They worked on several different campaigns and passionately fought for LGBT rights. They were together for over 50 years, and they were the first couple married in San Francisco in 2008, before Prop 8.      There are more people I wish I could add to this list. Basically, my question is… why do we seem to value people like Ellen and Megan Fox over these people?</detail>

I know of the events and climate for LGBT people in the US before Stonewall.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  What about Bayard Rustin? Duanna Johnson? Silvia Rivera?</answer>
        <answer>I knew of him.  I was wandering around Wikipedia, reading about the Moscone Center in San Francisco, a convention center named after Mayor Moscone, and I read about the mayor, then about the story of his assassination, then about Harvey Milk.  This was about three years ago, well before the film was released, and I'm only 19.</answer>
        <answer>Sadly, I honestly did not know who Harvey Milk was before the recent film. And I like Ellen because of her energy and her goofy nature, I do not however like Megan Fox I believe she is snooty!</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>The quality of life is very high in all those areas.    For settling down I would choose Valencia, because it's a worldly city by the sea but doesn't seem as weighed down by tourism as Barcelona. I've always found it very similar to Madrid, but with a beach. Alicante is similar to Valencia but a bit smaller and I think with a more Andalusian feel.    I wouldn't choose Barcelona simply because I personally believe Catalan to be an ugly and unappealing language, and a few people refuse to speak to...</answer>
        <answer>The streets of Barcelona are alive by day or night, providing the visitor with a safe place for strolling around, whether for shopping, eating or simply passing the time of day. There is also 1 mile long city beach with clean soft sand, ideal for sun bathing.</answer>
        <answer>I lived in barcelona for four months.  i would not raise a family there.  I absolutely loved it, but you literally live on top of people in a big apartment complex without a yard. no where to run around and do "kid" things.  Of course there are parks...but even a wide open soccer field is hard to find. people just play in plazas or wherever they can find.  little privacy.  more for a younger crowd and tourists.</answer>

You can get the box at anytime at your nearest post office and can check the price with their automated post office machine.  z</answer>
        <answer>Is it food?  Do you need overnight delivery?  Then a lot.  Otherwise, the post office has something called "flat rate" which it doesn't matter how much something weighs if you can fit it into a box, they vary, then it is not so much......I think $13.95.</answer>

      <title>How difficult is it to get a commission as a JAG?</title>
      <detail>I am enlisting an the National Guard, and I plan on attending Infantry basic and AIT this summer.        I have my bachelors degree, and I am well on my way to finishing my first year of Law School.      The plan is to do basic this summer (2009), and accept the 2 year "College First" deferment.  Next summer (2010) I would go to OCS in a TBA MOS.      My question is this: when I receive my Law Degree in (2011) and pass the Bar, how difficult will it be to get my commission as a JAG?      My recruiter has said that it is a simple "direct commission," but all the literature I have read makes it sound like there is a fairly intense selection process.      So, What is it?</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Military</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>1. JAG commissions are direct.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  2. JAG commissions are VERY tough to get. VERY competitive.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Example from the medical side: I am a former USAF Psychologist. I needed a Ph.D. and a license to get my O-3 commission. At the time I applied, I was also ABPP (Board Certified). I was also a prior service SSgt. And I was told that my acceptance was a "borderline" situation, and that without the ABPP cert., I would not have been accepted.</answer>

      <title>If the OSS was established in the 1940's, then what was the name of its predecessor?</title>
      <detail>Surely, there must have been an intelligence organization even before the OSS was established?  In Russia, for example, there was an agency called Okhranka in the 19th century, which was the predecessor of the VCHK (that's how the KGB's predecessor was called). There must have been a similar organization in the US.</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Nope, not really, though your history of Russian Intel is very accurate, with the provision that Okhrana/Cheka/NKVD etc was actually more concerned with what we would now call "Counterintelligence".  In the US, that's the bailiwick of the FBI..  Up until the formation of the OSS, Treasury, State and the Army/Navy had their own intelligence services.  In fact, one of the reasons for the intelligence about Japanese intentions slipping through the cracks, was the lack of an overarching intelligence...</answer>
        <answer>There was no unified service.   Each service had its own intelligence department.   Probably closest thing to the OSS was MI-8, also sometimes called "The American Black Chamber," a code-breaking outfit headed by Herbert O. Yardley (later more famous as the author of "The Education of A Poker Player).   The  links below may be helpful.</answer>
        <answer>the okhrana was a secret police not an inteligence gathering organization  they did not spy on other countries but rather on their own people  the oss was teh first organization of its kind..    actually.. that is not true. the oldest secret service is that of the Vatican.. yes they have one</answer>
        <answer>No, there was not.  First of all, prior to WW2, the US was heavily influenced by the isolationist movement.  A foreign intelligence service doesn't mesh well with that.    The Russian example brings up another point.  (I won't go into how you need to do a bit of pounding of square pegs into round holes to say that Okhranka/VCHK/KGB fit in the same family.  The Okhranka for example, was far closer to Hitler's Gestapo or the Iranian Shah's Savvak.)  In the 19th century, what involvement did the US...</answer>
        <answer>There was none.  Before the OSS, American intelligence had been an ad-hoc enterprise carried out by a variety of departments, including State, Treasury, Army, Navy, and War.  The situation persisted somewhat even after the formation of the OSS; for example, intelligence work in the Western Hemisphere was handled largely by the FBI, while Army Intelligence and Navy Intelligence fought hard to retain their independence from the OSS.</answer>

All you have to do is get your credit report from all three companies then dispute anything that you don't think is correct.  Nobody nor any law office that claims to wipe out bad credit, can wipe out bad credit.  All the law office is going to do is write disputes for every one of your bad listings on your credit report.

If you want to know where Adam gets his inspirations, go on his Myspace page, (Owl City is a one-man band), and scroll to the bottom. He has listed practically all of his inspirations. His Myspace page is simply called Owl City btw. His next album is said to be coming out around next spring. Maybe earlier. He recently just wrote his latest blog about his new album.

      <title>Costs of living in Bahrain?</title>
      <detail>Hi I've been offered a job in Bahrain and just need some info on the average monthly income and expenses for a single person relocating that side. The salary I've been offered is in AED (2800) which equates to abt 288BD. This sounds really bad after reading all the posts on this site. The company has offered to bear all relocation costs, medical expenses, transport to and from work and about 103BD towards accommodation. We will be placed 4 in an apartment so the rental would probably come down. All I need to pay is my personal expenses and food. I'd also like to save a little every month. Any information on this would be appreciated. Please advise if this would be a fair salary for a single person in Bahrain?</detail>
      <category>Travel;Africa &amp; Middle East;Bahrain</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I wouldn't say its the best salary but if your rent and transportation is covered you will survive and can save a little.  Try to find a better offer if not just take it.</answer>
        <answer>compared to the standards of living the salary is low.    But....    since you will share the apartment and you are single and not spend much than it will let you live to the end of the month.    you can save less than half your salary which is good.</answer>
        <answer>There is not much tax you have to pay. So, the saving depends directly on how you live. There are so many ways to spend your money. If you restrict your self for a certain money to spend, then it is always possible to save. Cost of living is not so high as compared to other gulf countries.</answer>

I would like to work for the CIA, but preferably in an administrative position or something like that. Is that possible? Is it extremely hard to get in the CIA? Do you have to be extremely intelligent?  What else should I know?</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Law Enforcement &amp; Police</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>it's possible. You do not have to be extremely intelligent, and with that psych degree, it will help. You should know the CIA is very secretive. This message will self destruct in 30 seconds. Good luck.</answer>
        <answer>Google CIA and look under the "Careers" link. You need absolutely no experience in the field, though it helps. You don't have to be extremely intelligent but the testing will route out anyone who isn't smart enough to complete their day to day tasks. Keep in mind though, working in the CIA doesn't have a very high pay rate and you can't exactly leave or quit once you get hired on.</answer>
        <answer>You don't have to be extremely smart if you just want to do administrative stuff, but you DO have to be eligible for top secret security clearance.  This means you have to be patriotic, emotionally and mentally stable, and very trustworthy.</answer>
        <answer>Yeah... You do need to be pretty intelligent... The CIA is a lot of record keeping and paperwork. Usually they are just spying. The FBI is turning the same way. Since only 15% of the FBI and CIA are field agents and the rest sit on computers... Im guessing you need to be pretty smart to be out in the field. Best of luck</answer>

So I'm still gonna keep my name "Stranger in California" and you guys can still keep yours, but we'll all be in a MJ forum where we can talk about whatever we want without worrying about haters or being reported.

        <answer>There's no such thing as a "compassionate" politician. There's always an ulterior motive behind politics.</answer>
        <answer>If you mean in the definition of "compassionate", GW's 45 Billion in aid to Africa for desease control and AIDS medications, or the Billions we've spent on repairing a low-grade slum like New Orleans, or Billions more on Medicare perscriptions for needy elderly people, then yes, you get a compassionate conservative.</answer>
        <answer>Actually, McCain wants to go even further in debt to Communist China than President Bush took us.

      <title>Alexander vs Genghis Khan?</title>
      <detail>Alexander conquered from west to east and was called The great Greek hero. Genghis Khan conquered from east to west and was called a Barbarian! Why do many historians and scholars favor Alexander? He's always depicted as a great man who conquered the ancient world in text books. But Genghis Khan is depicted as a barbarian conqueror.  Some common Arguments I've heard so far. Alexander didn't destroy like Genghis : Not true! Alexander conquered many countries and thousand of people died. (Both his allies and enemies)  Alexander only fought when it was necessary: If he had stayed in Greece there would be no fighting in the first place!! It's like saying I'll conquer your country. But don't fight me.   Alexander lived in palaces while Genghis lived in tents: That's as good as saying a man is great when he has lot of wealth!  In my opinion either both of them should be great conquerors or both of them should be barbarians.  Why the discrimination?  Thanks in advance :)</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>

        <answer>The reason why Genghis Khan is recognized as a Barbarian is because of extensive lack of knowledge, for example, he did not conquer East to West, but North to South, into China.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another reason I can think of is because of the humiliation the Mongols have caused, even to the point, I've seen it, where historians claimed that the Mongol horde outnumbers professional armies of Europe in huge numbers.

      <detail>I mean the western world when through a period of darkness during the middle ages (hence the term "dark ages") where innovation, medicine, progress and rational thought took a back seat to ideology and superstition.  We also suffered a similar set back during the dark decade of the Howard government who managed to convince the uneducated and uncouth how great they were at economic management whilst riding on the wave of economic boom set up by the Keating/Hawke government. Though of course that government was primarily driven by conservative ideology and a conservative agenda which had a whole host of negative impacts on our multicultural society.  And now we fave the prospect of Tony Abbott (an utterly myopic personality driven purely conservative Catholic ideology) becoming PM given that there is so much negative sentiment towards Gillard even from those who have been traditional Labor voters.  Sure, the era of having a visionary pioneering leader was over after the Keating/Hawke years, but wouldn't we just hang our heads in utter shame if at the notion of a Coalition governement lead by "Prime Minister Tony Abbott"?

      <answers>
        <answer>Car rental for 2 days would run under 70 dollars.  drive time is about 4.5 hours.....280 miles.    Train takes about 8 hours and runs about 35 dollars each way and service is currently disrupted due to mudslides outside of sea.    I would go with a rental car. Nice scenery...should be a good drive.    Flying southwest from sea to Spokane would run about $120.00 round trip with the taxes, with a good internet fare, there are about 4 flights a day.</answer>
        <answer>Greyhound bus showed this price for 1 person round trip.     1   Adult   $40.50     $40.50        http://www.greyhound.com/      Hope that helped...:)</answer>
        <answer>If you can make a good airport connection and have more money than time, consider flying without leaving the airport.     If you want to see anything but airports, or if you can't make an easy connection rent a car. Getting to the airport early, waiting, and flying will take almost as long as driving.     Spend a night in the Seattle area, drive across the state in the daytime and enjoy the scenery. It's all freeway.</answer>
        <answer>It would be easiest to just drive on I-90 from seattle to spokane.  Its about a 4-5 hour drive.      You could fly also but that would not be cheap, although the flight is only about an hour or so.</answer>

      <title>MTA fare hike?</title>
      <detail>Why are NY'ers so upset by a .25 MTA fare hike, YES it's a hike but it's just now an extra quarter out of your pocket, people should be happy it's not a buck or two ... god forbid</detail>
      <category>Travel;United States;New York City</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I work for MTA and I'm gonna say they wanna raise the fare because of the rider if some stop jumping or beating there fares. If people stop treating the trains and buses like there garbage's they would have to hire and extra 500 cleaners which they are doing now, If they stop destroying things that have to be replaced etc etc people don't realize the more damage they do the more it cost the MTA and they have to pay for it some kinda way dont u think....</answer>
        <answer>NY'er are upset because they want to know where all this money is going.  The MTA squanders hundreds of millions of dollars.  One year they are showing huge deficits, the next huge surpluses.  There is something very wrong with the management there.  Also, that 25 cents adds up fast.  The extra $10 a month is a lot of money to some people. And that's if they use the subway only twice a day on weekdays.  On top of that, they are taking about fair hikes on the commuter rail lines.    NYer's should...</answer>
        <answer>We're upset, like the first poster mentioned, because MTA is so mis-managed.  They hike fares up and meanwhile, 90% of the trains and stations in this city are falling apart.  I don't remember the last time I was in a station that wasn't falling apart due to lack of repairs.  Another example--they're spending millions trying to figure out how to space cars on the L train.  Millions of dollars!  Just to experiment with train spacing.    If they're going to hike our fares, let's see some progress ...</answer>
        <answer>Because the money is funny. No accountability. The MTA is ALWAYS looking for an increase of $$$$$$$ and the service stays the same.</answer>
        <answer>i agree with the others who have complained about the MTA, but they are only half the problem.    the other half is labor, the TWU, etc. those who work for transit are certainly hamstrung by the limits of what management has given them, like not enough trains, and all that, but labor hasn't taken care to use those limited tools wisely. the problem is that the people who work for transit come from cultures that do not value efficiency and good customer service as much as we would like.    if they...</answer>

      <title>Recently I was dating someone who works for the NSA and he hacked into my Yahoo/internet. Is that legal?</title>
      <detail>This person abused the knowledge he has of the internet and computers - his training.  He obviously has emotional issues as he felt he had to spy on me and my child, as my son uses the pc as well.  My computer was acting odd, as was my Internet and my Yahoo Messenger.  I suspected he was hacking into my pc, and then he admitted it.  He accused me of things that did not occur, so I am not sure just what his motivation was.  However, it does make me very uncomfortable that this is a person whom we trust to watch over our safety and he chooses to abuse and stalk the private sector in his spare time.  There are hearings going on right now about the possibilities of this exact personal abuse transpiring by members of the NSA to the public.  I can tell you it does occur.  I cannot believe this is legal or just.  It certainly is terrifying as I use my pc for personal finances, etc.  Now I no longer feel secure in my own home.

Used a 'key logger' to monitor your activity (which also gives him your passwords)    2. Used knowledge about you to reset your yahoo password.    ...either way, I doubt this is related to his job.

        <answer>Adding more "Jessie's Girl" trivia to RadTech's excellent (and quite correct!) answer:    Rick lost touch with Gary ("Jessie") and his girlfriend before the song was ever recorded.  Rick doubts that the couple even knows the song is about them.  (Unless, of course, they have followed his career and have been able to do the math from the numerous interviews Rick has given on the subject)    The correct spelling of the song title is "Jessie", not "Jesse".      Rick thought his friend's real name, ...</answer>
        <answer>I don't know if he got Jessie's girl...but he definitely scored a lot of beautiful girls as a rock star and soap opera star.</answer>
        <answer>He probably got her then decided actually he didn't want her and shagged he's way through a bunch of groupies and supermodels.    Men</answer>
        <answer>At least once in every guys life, likely ladies too, they will have a desire for a friends squeeze.  If they want to keep the friendship, then they just get past it.  If not, they may force the issue, and sometimes get the girl and sometimes they lose both.  Odd that Layla is playing on my ipod at this very moment.  (Layla was directed to George Harrison's wife, who Eric Clapton won from George).  So I think that if Rick was serious about Jessie's Girl, he got her.</answer>
        <answer>No, but I heard he got Jessie's Mom.</answer>

      <title>MIT Addmission?!Help for 10 points please?!?</title>
      <detail>Hello guys,   This is actually a question with many sub-questions, so please bear with me.      I am currently an 8th grader attending Hopkins Junior High school-it’s very reputed, and in half an year, I’ll be going to Mission San Jose High(a VERY good high school-top 40 in nation). My grades were:      From K-4th: straight A’s/Outstanding   5th-6th: A’s with some B’s   7th-8th:Mostly B’s, some A’s      The only problem is, I REALLY want to M.I.T.. I am prepared to sacrifice my free time, or anything else needed. So far, in 7th grade I took Woodshop and Arts &amp; Crafts as my electives. This year, I am taking Spanish 1. I was wondering how my classes should be in high school… Mainly, I’m worried about the AP classes requirements. Mission offers a wide variety of AP classes, but I’m not sure which ones to take. Plus, Mission also offers after-school 7th period (year long) of Computer Animation, and Scenic Arts, so when should I be taking those?      I apologize for bombarding you guys with so much, but I really am committed to this.   To sum it up:   How should I bring my grades up to all A’s again?   What classes should I take? (Please, give me a list or a layout of when to take which class)   What type of extracurricular activites should I take(I was on my Bball team in 6th grade, but never made it in 7th or 8th.)   If you happen to be from MIT, or know someone that attended MIT, please tell me info about your/their grades in high school, GPA, extracurricular activities, etc.   Any other tips would be appreciated as well.      By the way, please DO NOT respond with a link answer or something like “worry about that later”, etc.      Thanks SO much-10 points+I’ll try to answer all your questions to someone who answers all/most questions with DETAIL.      P.S. I joined Boy Scouts a month ago, and am trying to get Eagle Scout before 12th is over.</detail>

        <answer>From 7th or 8th grade, it is far too early judge your ability to get into a school like MIT.  However, it is never to early to think about it.  But I think you need to be flexible and remember that in 4 years, you may not want to or may not have an option to go to MIT.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  You bring up your elementary school grades.  You should realize that elementary school grades have no influence nor any predictive value for what your grades moving on will be.  So stop worrying about them and stop thin...</answer>

      <title>Why do so few American mothers breastfeed their babies until 1 year as recommended for health by the AAP?</title>
      <detail>Do you think it's because America has over-sexualized female breasts? Because women aren't supported? Uneducated? Selfish? What do you think?    I read a study that says that even though the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend breastfeeding for a minimum of a year, only 2% of American Mom's make it this long. But that the ones who do managed to breastfeed to a year and beyond have children with the highest I.Q.'s, lowest rate of allergies and lowest death rayes from SIDS or childhood cancers (they also tend to live longer and be healthier throught their entire lives according to this study). Women in Sweden breastfeed for over a year (90% do!) so I'm wondering why American women don't??</detail>
      <category>Pregnancy &amp; Parenting;Parenting</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I suppose it's because many American women go right back to work within a few months after giving birth. In other countries, women are more traditional so they stay home longer or they were always housewives.</answer>
        <answer>I think it's mainly a convenience thing. Women in the US don't get much time for maternity leave, so they see it as a bigger hassle to breastfeed while working than to not. Women in Canada get a year's paid leave, oh wouldn't that be nice!!</answer>
        <answer>because everything in America costs too much. the majority of women work full time jobs and do not have the time to breast feed more than a few months. right now i'm on maternity leave, but i have a full time and a part time job that i have to go back to soon and there is no way that i can keep up a milk supply long enough to breastfeed for a year.</answer>
        <answer>My daughter weaned her self. I wasn't going to let her starve, so I gave her a bottle.</answer>
        <answer>Most women have to work therefor breastfeeding for a lengthy time is not an option.  It can require two incomes to make things meet here.  Also, breastfeeding is only better than bottle by small fractions.  A lot of American women do pump so the babies are still getting breastmilk, just from a bottle.</answer>

      <detail>Many sellers on eBay offer unlocking services for the AT&amp;T iPhone, usually they just ask for the IMEI number on the phone, you plug it into iTunes and voila, you have an unlocked iPhone for all (or most) GSM carriers.  Do you need to go through the initial activation process/screen in order to have it unlocked? I currently have T-mobile as my carrier, if I buy a used AT&amp;T iPhone, should I be confident that I can unlock it without activating it through apple or inserting an AT&amp;T sim card first?  Hope my question makes sense to those familiar with the unlocking process on the iPhone! Thanks in advance.</detail>

        <answer>I can unlock it without any problems. Through your IMEI, I am able to unlock any operator. The release is the official Apple, and you'll need to connect your iPhone to iTunes to get it unlocked. Then you can use it with any SIM card. Contact me at unlockiphone19@gmail.com for any information.</answer>

        <answer>Purdue is a very selective university.  I suggest you go to the web site and find the statistics for the current freshman class, which with most schools will show test score ranges and averages, class rank ranges and averages, and with some schools will also include grade point information.  If your stats are within the ranges, you have a fairly decent shot at admissions, and if they are lower, your chances are certainly less favorable.

        <answer>What you've heard is correct. Their first album, Turn on the Bright Lights, is usually considered to be their best album, and I would have to thoroughly agree. Their second album, Antics, is also quite good, but I wouldn't mess with it unless you like TOTBL. As for the other two, try them out, you might possibly like them. Their recent self-titled sounds like early New Order, if you're into that sort of thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BQ: NYC</answer>

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Military</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The Vietnam War ended witht the Treaty of Paris in 1972.  Both sides agreed to the peace agreement.  We pulled out in 1973 after we were sure that the South Vietnamese were going to stand on their own.  We did have some troops still there in limited advisory roles, and of course the Marine Embassy Guards.  Between 72 and 75 there was no war as it was over.  In 1975 however, the North broke the treaty and invaded the South.</answer>
        <answer>Troops - no.  1250 Americans remained on the final day.  Two were killed when shelling at Ton Son Nhut wiped out the last US Galaxy Cargo plane, airlifting refugees, and the Marines guarding the embassy did the final helicopter evacuation as the NVA entered the city.</answer>
        <answer>they were at the embassy helping with the evacuation. They had to defend the embassy because some many people where trying get out that they were climbing over the walls and fences into the helicopters.</answer>

        <answer>The payload and performance are not the primary concern, unless on-going development would result in a weight increase of systems.&lt;br&gt;The major issue with the plane is that it is behind schedule and way over budget, with several issues still to be resolved (which will keep adding more delay and cost).&lt;br&gt;And a late and too costly airplane is likely to sell in smaller numbers, which will mean development cost will be spread over a smaller number of units, leading to still higher unit cost.</answer>

        <answer>Must be the pc. The game can handle upto 60 horde zombies at any one time so if your graphics card is the issue time to invest in a new pc or just a new graphs card.&lt;br&gt;  You haven't given us any specs to your pc. What are they?&lt;br&gt;  Also why go for cheap download rip? Just get the original from Steam or a shop. The multi player option is much better than solo mode.</answer>
        <answer>Turn down the quality in the options  menu on the main screen. And close down all programs that might slow down L4D</answer>
        <answer>u got 3d card or not? if ot ur pc is going to lag u should get a 3d card for ur pc.if u are using vista u must watch it's graphic cause it still can support but also lag if ur graphic good it &lt;br&gt;  ]will not lag anymore</answer>

There are only two or three listings on ebay and none of them have bids. :/ I want this stuff to go, but I don't want to just give it away.. it's fine china, and discontinued. Help?</detail>
      <category>Food &amp; Drink;Entertaining</category>

        <answer>Try contacting Replacements Limited.  I have used them to replace broken pieces of discontinued china and they are a great company.  They also handle current patterns, as well.    I've linked their page about buying china...they have an 800 number, so give them a call and see what they would pay for it!!    Good luck!</answer>
        <answer>Try Craigslist. If that doesn't work, check eBay again. Sometimes things sell, sometimes they don't. Check often. The companies that buy offer very little, as they have to resell them.</answer>

        <answer>why yea, if you're still using  IE, it'll feel like walking to a plane (plane being the chrome DUH) i was using firefox which is fast already but chrome is faster than it. it's also lighter on memory usage, less strain on computer. i suggest you use it. i had some trouble getting used to the interface though,,, but yes you should try it, fastest browser other than safari (which i dont like, sorry apple fanboy/girls)</answer>
        <answer>Yes, definitely. In fact I am using it right now. It is significantly faster than firefox and IE 8 for that matter. I love it.

However youtube videos slightly freeeze randomly.

      <title>What was Hitler's view on Turkey?</title>
      <detail>Also, is Turkey considered as an European or an Asian country??</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Hitler was a vegetarian...but on a serious note, the Nazis desperately wanted Turkey to join the Axis (it would have put overwhelming pressure on British forces in the Mediterannean) but Turkey remained neutral until February 1945 when they joined the Allies. Politically speaking Turkey's a European country even though half of it is geographically in Asia.</answer>
        <answer>As far as I am aware, Hitler did not concern himself with Turkey.&lt;br&gt;  Fighting a war on two fronts (following 1941) he had little time for such an insignificant country however i believe had he repelled the allies and ascertained his 'lebensraum' from Russia he would have turned his attention to turkey and other countries for the pure reason of possessing them, being the demonic control freak that he was.</answer>
        <answer>I believe Hitler was a bigger fan of chicken and beef.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  oh and Turkey is in Asia and Europe but considered more European as the sports teams play in the European league</answer>
        <answer>Great on christmas.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  It's poultry.</answer>
        <answer>These answers are all *facepalm*. &lt;br&gt;  He wanted to use Turkey as ally but Turkey tried to stay neutral for whole war and they did. Hitler didn't wanted to attack it he would enter Middle east for the north (Caucasus). I think if he attacked them he they would probably join them like Hungary did. About minorities there were no Turks in Germany in WW2 or before that they moved in in 1960s and after (WW2 ended 1945).</answer>

      <category>Travel;Air Travel</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>If you are an EU citizen it is unlikely that you would need a transit visa. Some countries do require transit visas, depending on the nationality of the person transiting. (ie, if you were an Indian citizen transferring in the UK, you would need one). You can always contact their consulate to get more detailed information if you would like.</answer>
        <answer>No, for all airports worldwide you do not require a visa to transfer planes if you just wait inside the air-side terminal. You will, however, need a valid visa if you intend to leave the terminal - the people at customs will stop you.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  As long as your connection is within 24 hours you won't need anything.</answer>
        <answer>Nope. No Visa is needed just for a transfer to another flight.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Have a great trip!</answer>

      <detail>My wife needs a visa for European Union (Schengen visa). I know that cruise passengers don't need visa to visit Saint Petersburg even though Russia requires visas from pretty much everyone. But my question is, has anyone been on a cruise that included Saint Petersburg? Was there any passport check on the way back to the ship after visiting Saint Petersburg?

        <answer>She needs to get a double entry Schengen visa since the cruise ship leaves and re-enters the Schengen zone by stopping in Saint Petersburg. Schengen immigration control will be conducted at the last port of call in a Schengen country before going to Saint Petersburg and at the first port of call in the Schengen zone after leaving Saint Petersburg. It is easily to get the double entry visa based on the cruise itinerary if all other requirements are met and you state that the cruise ship is stoppi...</answer>
        <answer>We did St Petersburg last year and the cruise line arranged any visas we needed when we booked our city excursions with them. If you booked your own excursions you had to arrange your own visas. For us the passports were checked when we arrived in St Petersburg and again when we left. We both had UK passports.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Have a great time, it's a splendid city.</answer>
        <answer>We were on Princess and they arranged everything for the shore excursions into St Petersburg.  The Russians had set up a series of checkpoints which we went through on our way off the ship and then again on our way back in.   We had no problems and we didn't have to do anything before the cruise...Princess arranged it all since we booked through their excursions.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I'd check with your cruiseline to make sure.</answer>

      <detail>A democracy is a system whereby the consent of the people decides the ruling government.....How can a country which has had the same party for 98% of the time be considered to a democracy?    In a democracy, there is free speech for the people to express themselves - In India whoever criticises Islam gets a fatwa or whoever criticises Gandhi gets beatings.    In a democracy there is a free press that is independent of the goverment and imparts free and fair and unbias news reports - In India the press is extremely bias and is always favours the Congress party and communists and marxists and always unjustly criticises the BJP. In part this is due to the fact that the Indian media is run by psuedo seculars who are anti-Hindu as well as the fact that it is funded by Christian organisations.    In a democracy there is no limits to education - whereas in India the Congress party deliberatly keep the populace illiterate in order to stay in power...Moreover Hindu educational institutions are not permitted whereas Christian schools are allowed as are Islamic madrasas that preach extremism.....</detail>

      <detail>I question it because Chechnya, Dagestan and Tatarstan are muslim-majority provinces of Russia (Tatar, Chechen and Dagesi)      thank you, very much</detail>

      <answers>
        <answer>For about the past year, things in Chechnya, Dagestan and Tatarstan have been, more or less quiet, though recently there have been a couple of bombings.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The for the most part, you should take caution if you are considering going there.  First off, foreigners are easy to spot there and so it would make them big targets for extremists.  Secondly, those areas are highly restricted and very difficult to get to if you are a foreigner.  The Russian government keeps close tabs on everyone ...</answer>
        <answer>The risk of dying in such an attack is 100% for the bomber, unless he is an exceptionally stupid suicide bomber (and you've got to be pretty dumb to do that anyway).&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I would venture to guess that for the bombed individuals, the risk of dying is proportional in some way to the strength of the blast, size of the individual, coverage (substantial clothing, a desk, etc) and physical proximity to the bomber.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I would think that the risk to all parties involved is completely ind...</answer>

      <title>Fun, Long Baby Name Game [Plus BQ's]!?</title>
      <detail>1. At your big high school graduation party, you and your boyfriend celebrate by sleeping together. About a month or so later, you discover that you're pregnant. Your boyfriend keeps his plans to go to college, leaving you no choice but to drop out so you can raise the baby. The money from your college fund goes to the first month's rent on a new apartment in what city?      2. Seven months after you settle into the apartment, the baby is born. You've had a complicated pregnancy, and he arrives a month early. Though his lungs are a little underdeveloped, he's otherwise healthy. His initials are the first letter of the city and state/country you live in.      3. When your son is two years old, you begin taking classes at a local community college. One day, as you're rushing from class to pick your son up from daycare, you bump into a guy from your class. He sees you're in a rush, and asks if you want to go for a cup of coffee some other time, and you agree. His name is?      4. After dating him for three months, you reveal to him that you have a son. He's surprisingly fine with it, and even goes as far to eagerly ask to meet him. You two take your son to the park, and you are ecstatic to see how well they get along. Another ten months pass by, and your son is three when your boyfriend proposes. You say yes, of course, and marry not long later. You take a relaxing two week honeymoon to...?      5. You and your husband want to start trying for another baby immediately. It takes a few months, but finally, just after your son turns four, you discover you're pregnant with twins! Eight months later, you give birth to two healthy little girls. The first is named after your grandmother, who passed away recently, and the other name your husband chooses.      6. Your son is seven, and the twins are two. Your son is begging to get a pet, so you and your husband finally relent and take him to the animal shelter to pick out a dog. What breed is it, and what is it's name?      7. Shortly after the dog joins the family, you find out that a new baby will as well! It's another tough pregnancy for you, and you deliver your little girl a month earlier via c-section. The doctor recommends no more pregnancies for you. You give the little girl a virtue name.      8. You and your husband always wanted a big family, and while you love your four children, you long for more. When your son is eleven, the twins are six, and your daughter is three, you adopt a two year old boy from Peru. What is his name?      Yay for your big happy family! :) Here's the BQ's:   1.] What are your favorite names (first and middle) for a boy and a girl?   2.] Do you have any least favorite names?   3.] How many kids do you want to have one day? Or if you already have kids, how many do you have and do you want anymore?   4.] What are your favorite celebrity baby names (boy and girl)?      I might post my answers later. I just did this because I was bored. I hope you liked it!</detail>

      <title>How many jobs has Rush Limbaugh created with his Bush tax cuts over the last 8 years?</title>
      <detail>He keeps telling the mindless masses that if they cut his (and the taxes of the richest people) they will create jobs.      Where are those jobs?        During the entirety of Bush's two terms, only about 400,000 total jobs were created and 38% (150,000) were federal govt. jobs.      So where are all these jobs we were promised by giving enormous tax handouts to the rich?      Why did the IRS have to sue Switzerland banks to get the names of 52,000 Americans who were evading taxes by hiding their Bush tax cuts, if that money was being used to create jobs?      So where are the jobs?  The Bush tax cuts haven't expired, nor have they been repealed.</detail>

        <answer>That really comes down to what you want out of your smartphone.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple is extremely reliable for its extremely high quality materials on its iPhones, iPods, and iPads (which also jacks up the prices to high values).  Apple also provides quick updates to all of their devices so long as it's still within the time to be updated (at least every iDevice has an update for a year and a half to 2 years.)  Because Apple's stores are pretty high in the security, you would deliberately have to look...</answer>
        <answer>They are both equally reliable when it comes to phones. Both use high quality material when making their phones and the software works well on both. When comparing HTC and Apple you would need to compare another category if you want to find a difference.</answer>
        <answer>Apple &gt; HTC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;@sky5racer: Price &amp; component sourcing (which Apple no longer employs Samsung for) has nothing to do with reliability.</answer>

        <answer>Yes the Vatican City is a diferent country altogether, its also the smallest state on earth, is only about 3.2km around its borders. However it is still governed by Italian laws but has its own set of rules etc. No there is no customs and no tangible border that seperates it from the rest of Italy besides the walls.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  With a little more than 100 acres (less than half a square kilometer) within its walls, the Vatican is easily traveled by foot; however, most of this area is inaccessible ...</answer>
        <answer>yes it is a different city, but it is so small that it gets a lot of stuff from Rome. So, politically it is a different city, but in real life it is not.

        <answer>I'd disagree on getting a whitewater kayak. For rivers (assuming calm, not whitewater) and lakes, most recreational kayaks, including sit-on-tops, will work fine. For the Atlantic, it depends where, when, and what conditions you're planning to paddle in. If you're only out in protected areas when its calm, then most kayaks will do fine (but get lessons or advice for your area so you understand the weather and won't get caught by surprise). But if you're going out when there's wind and surf, get ...</answer>
        <answer>Buy a standard model whitewater kayak. Perhaps 4 meters long. You need a boat that will handle your choice of extreme conditions. The Atlantic is your most difficult venue. A sit-on-top may not be what you need. You will get wet. Find a canoe/kayak group near you and get thoughts. A kayak requires or almost always uses a double-bladed paddle. Alternate side strokes help to keep the boat stable. Try a Mohawk paddle. Erect the paddle to a vertical position, one blade on the ground and the other in...</answer>

Of interest is that yeast wasn't in the original list because at time of publication of Reinheitsgebot (1516) it wasn't known that yeast caused the fermentation.&lt;br&gt;Both Heineken and Becks report that they only use water, barley, hops and yeast in their beers, giving the 'purity' that they ...</answer>
        <answer>When someone says it abides by a purity law, they simply mean they've limited the ingredients to water, barley and hops, and yeast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The traditional Reinheitsgebot, not an actual written law.</answer>

      <detail>In Miss Saigon, I got put into the ensemble, does that include the character Mimi Yvette or Yvonne? I know for stuff like "Morning of the dragon" that would be the ensemble...but would you consider those three girls as part of the ensemble?</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;Theater &amp; Acting</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Yes the bar girls Mimi, Yvette or Yvonne can perform as part of the ensemble.  I don' t know how your director does things, but usually if you were cast as one of them you would have been told you were cast as "Mimi" (or one of the other girls) rather than told you are part of the ensemble.  Generally, when someone is cast in the ensemble they don't have a specific character name.</answer>
        <answer>Ensemble usually means that your character doesn't have a name or any lines spoken individually - just singing with everyone else, and speaking as a group.</answer>

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Travel;Italy</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>    The city of Padua (Lat. Patavium, It. Padova) is the economic and communications hub of the Veneto region in northern Italy. The capital of Padova province, it stands on the Bacchiglione River, 40km west of Venice and 29km southeast of Vicenza, with a population of 211,985 (2004).</answer>
        <answer>They are both the same.  Padova is in Italian.  You may also encounter 'Patavium', that's in Latin.</answer>
        <answer>It's the same thing, the difference comes from the old Latin alphabet. The Romans only had the letter "V" to signify both the modern "V" and the modern "U". So in Latin, the city would be written as "Padva" or "Padova" (add a vowel to ease pronunciation). If you replace the 'V' with a "U" (more common in modern languages), you'll get "PadUa".</answer>
        <answer>both are good enough! and Padova is second to Napoli for the nicest women! :)</answer>

      <title>Justin Bieber fans, why are you a fan of him?</title>
      <detail>positive feedback only      I ask because you know when people call themselves fans, fan is a strong word and you look up to this person, so the person has to have a good reason for you to call yourself a fan. I want to know if I asked would you get mad or just tell me why. And I will say, I hope it's not that he is cute and makes good music, there a lot of men who do that. And a back story for why I am asking is that, I asked my sister this in a nice way and she said i was only asking because i was going to make fun of her, but if it was a good reason i would not. But then she stayed quiet, I said, you can't answer? And she said, No i can't, and i want you to leave me alone. Now before that i was talking somebody i know that is famous, and saying that i love him and know him and his life, i know his lifestyle and what he does in secret and i named values he holds on too, like honesty in music and deep stuff, people can all understand, and not fluffy stuff, but new and authentic stuff. And I said fan is a big word, she agreed with that. I said, so JB is the only person you are a fan of? And she said yes.</detail>

Does she play guitar or know someone who could play with her?  To be honest I think it'd be really hard to get gigs unless you know someone personally who would give her a shot.

        <answer>Faith used this expression to mean "everything is OK" but there has been no convincing explanation as to what it refers to. Since Faith was too young to be involved in WWII, and there is no indication she came from a military family, it seems unlikely that she would be referring to an obscure bit of military radio jargon.    That might make sense in JAG, of course.</answer>
        <answer>A military radio has signal strength measured in 1-5 and clarity on the same scale so 5X5 is the same as saying loud and clear.  This is appropriate jargon for JAG personal, why it is on Buffy, beats me.  (also used when on a CB in the same capacity, HAM radios use similar but on a 1-10, so there a 5x5 is OK, but not great)</answer>

        <answer>I doubt it because they would have known the consequences.</answer>
        <answer>Georgia has a bunch of warmongering butchers who would rather slaughter Russians in their country than improve their democracy. Georgia proved they aren't worthy of being in NATO, screw them.</answer>
        <answer>Right back in your face, that makes no sense. Almost all of eastern europe has Russian background... mostly because a lot of them used to be a part of Russia.</answer>
        <answer>It's a good question but let's be honest, we're not talking about NATO, we're talking about American hegemony around the world. With the present day world, where Russia has done away with communism and is now moving towards being a member of the capitalist world, why does the U.S.A. need to rub their noses into the ground by forming anti-Russian alliances with countries that are ex-members of the U.S.S.R.

All creatures cower seeking  shelter in mountain caves, in the ocean’s depths, while Persephone ignores Earth’s suffering.  She will not carpet the land with blossoms until her girlchild is released from Hades’ grasp.</detail>

        <answer>This is very well done. I like the imagery and freshness brought to this myth. I like the conciseness, the rhythm, the shifting landscapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, "She" in the last line seems applied to Persephone rather than Demeter. You could switch S2 and S3.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought: I found the word "ignores" to be somewhat ambivalent. Your interpretation of the story "until her girlchild is released" suggests that Persephone has no choice, whereas "ignores" is a deliberate action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the images...</answer>
        <answer>Did you get that tired at the end that you came up with a cliched title? lol  Check the two "ins" in S2. Maybe "and" for the second line? As for Persephone, isn't late typical for a woman? lol</answer>

        <answer>Since I' sure you went through the turn-it-off-then-back-on routine... Maybe, (BIG maybe), it thinks there is an external display attached.  On most notebooks/laptops this is a "toggle" feature.  On the space bar row of your keyboard, there is a dark or shaded (usually blue) key labeled "Fn".  Press that key and hold it down then press the "F4" key ... Fn+F4... (or the F  key that has a shaded monitor icon the same color as the Fn key.

        <answer>Do you have hot keys for your laptop? I know I have a button that if you hold it and press like f5 it will shut off my monitor or think its on an external Monitor. If you do you should try pressing those. They seem to be up in the f buttons. I have an Acer Laptop keep in mind.</answer>
        <answer>no I would not suggest on getting it fixed by best buy. they do not do a good job at all. If your laptop is still under warranty than I would call Gateway and tell them what is going on with your screen and they should send you a replacment screen. Even though your screen is less than a year old the screen just went bad on you and went out.</answer>
        <answer>Your laptop might have gotten stupid and think you have an external monitor.  If you do have an external monitor somewhere try plugging it in to the external monitor port.  Turn your laptop off first!  Boot up and see if the external monitor shows anything.      The laptop might be in sleep or hibernate mode - check your manual for correcting that.</answer>

      <detail>1. UN Security Council Resolution 242 calls on all parties to the conflict to negotiate a solution       2. It anticipates that Israel will withdraw to secure borders (not specified in the resolution) in exchange for peace guarantees from the Arab parties    The Resolution was carefully worded to require that Israel withdraw from "territories" rather than "the territories."  This construction, leaving out "the," was intentional, because it was not envisioned that Israel would withdraw from all the territories, thereby returning to the vulnerable pre-war borders. And any withdrawal would be such as to create "secure and recognized boundaries."    It was widely recognized that the balancing of the ideas of a territorial return with "secure and recognized boundaries" for Israel would mean that Israel would not be forced to withdraw from 100% of the land captured in the June 1967 war. There is a dispute between the British-American understanding of the wording of the resolution and the French</detail>

      <title>Halo 2 Zanzibar map assistance please?</title>
      <detail>I was watching the famous "Red vs. Blue" Halo comedies, and i recognized the Zanzibar map in one of the scenes.  Well, they kept opening and closing the big metal gate in that map, (This is the gate that has two windows above it that have shutters to protect the people inside)  I looked all over for a switch to open the gate, but i can't find one, so how do you open that gate?  Thanks.</detail>
      <category>Games &amp; Recreation;Video &amp; Online Games</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>There is no way to shut the gate after it has been opened. The creators of red vs. blue just took footage of the gate opening and played it in reverse to make it look like it was shutting. Also you can't stop the windmill. Those weak points on the generator are just for show. Also after you use the computer to open the gate, zoom in on the screen and read the writing its pretty funny.</answer>
        <answer>There's a computer looking thing in the second floor.  Look for it there.</answer>

        <answer>I don't think Obama will consider her.  The risk is too great of going to sleep with a 8mm path through his skull to make way for her presidential ambitions.  Even if he doesn't have that fear, she would be a very ambitious VP that gets publicly involved to a much greater extend than typical VPs do.  She would compete with him for the lime light.</answer>
        <answer>What happens when we have a democratic President, we have a Republican Senate.  It will not matter who is in office they will negate themselves.</answer>
        <answer>McCain thinks that Obama is naive and stupid.    It would be political suicide if Obama selected Hillary as VP.    By the way, when is YA going to add Sen. Obama's name to the spell check dictionary?  Hillary's name is obviously a part of the spell check system.  Is this another form of discrimination?</answer>

      <title>Subsidies to Help People Pay for Their Health Insurance -- Good Idea, or Not?</title>
      <detail>The subsidies would be for a limited class of taxpayers -- persons whose adjusted gross income was under $25,000 per year.      They would be in the form of a refundable tax credit for a certain percentage of the premiums paid out by the taxpayer (based on cancelled checks stapled to the 1040 Form).      They could only be reimbursed if their health insurance company was on a the Adequately Trusted Health Insurors (ATHI) List. Taxpayers who insure with any firm not on the ATHI list don't get to claim the refundable tax credit, even if they can show cancelled checks for health insurance they paid for.      This provision -- the ATHI list eliminates 90% of the would-be fraudsters, right at the starting line. 9 our of 10 system gamers don't even get to play. The ATHI list should be strict but not too strict. It must include most of the insurors, but eliminate let's say the bottom quartile -- the Least Trusted 25% -- because they are known to be thieves, suspected of being incompetent, corrupt, or litigitous, or because they don't offer an acceptable insurance product -- it's too limited, too small, too twisted to be of any good to anybody. Government should not pay for that. So the ATHI list is key. The Fed could start by asking the State Governors for consultative advice. They could put the list together in less than a year, for sure, and it would be pretty fair and reasonable, with procedures in place to appeal adverse determinations.      This program is based on the idea that "You get More of Things You Subsidize".      What we want more of is people paying for and getting decent health insurance.      OK, so that is what we subsidize. Very precisely that. Laser beam targeting. Narrowly focused on the objective. We could call it Management by Objectives, wow what an idea!      The idea would be to start small and affordable -- say the subsidy level is initially set at 25% of the taxpayers out of pocket insurance costs.      Is that going to attract everybody? No, but that's OK. It's enough to get a working cohort of program participants in the door so we can see what the effects are. Does this save money? Does it create a lot more insured people, or just a few. How much is saved by not having them among the uninsured?      OK -- 24 months have gone by -- it works! The group likes it -- is happy to have the reimbursement, and the healthcare providers are saying nice things about the idea.       So, we ramp it up -- let's say to 50% reimbursement. See how many more people that brings in. See how much more money we save -- by having more insured people. Study the probably point of optimization for this program.      Let's say the study says -- "Don't ramp it up any more." OK, then we don't.      Let's say the math boffins tell us go ahead all the way to 100%, you will make money by doing that." OK, so that's what we do.      :Let's call this reality-based policy (Technically in science, it is called the Monte Carlo Method -- the theory is developed straight out of incoming experimental data which we have no hypothesis about one way or the other as we begin the experiment).      You get more of things you subsidize. The shortest distance between two points is a straight intention to get it done. We want more people to buy healthcare insurance? Do we need Albert Einstein here to figure this out for us?      The management concept used here is called disjointed incrementalism. You try a little, see how it goes, then decide what to do next. It's really just the opposite of Obama Care which is Holistic Totalitarianism that runs in and steals people Medicare accounts to pay for Barack and ACORN's street people whose eyes are on the prize (of your cash).      This idea is workable, modest, scalable, affordable, targeted, and highly likely to get the results it seeks. That's what good policy looks like. The West Wing wouldn't know good policy if it bit them on the a&amp;$.      Why not print this out and send it to Barry? Ask him, "Why not the best?"</detail>

        <answer>Kurdistan is a region within northern Iraq, western Iran, and eastern Turkey where the Kurds live. Kurds are Muslim but ethnically distinct from Turks, Arabs, and Persians. Kurds want to maintain their ethnic identity, but the methods differ based on the country. In Iraq, the Kurds enjoy a degree of autonomy, but in Turkey some militant groups have been waging a guerrilla war for independence from Turkey for the last 20 years or so.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Hindustan is a general term for India and Pakistan, ...</answer>
        <answer>Kurdistan exists but is restricted to 3 Iraqi provinces at northern Iraq known officially as Kurdistan and semi-officially as Iraqi Kurdistan. Kurdistan is a geo-cultural area where "Kurds traditionally lived". Since Kurds are/were nomadic people, the boundaries of this area is not defined, most sources claim it is in the middle east somewhere. There is no agreement on the actual borders. &lt;br&gt;  The problem starts with the boundaries. They want to put their boundaries and make it official.</answer>

      <title>Is a company called "ABC Transport SA" fraudulent or legitimate?</title>
      <detail>I received an e-mail for a job offer with a company called ABC Transport SA. Normally when I see stuff like this in my e-mail, I immediately toss it in the trash bin as a phishing scam or some similar form of malicious content.      However, I was struck by the simple tone of this e-mail. It wasn't from a Nigerian address, nor did it have poorly constructed English grammar. It seemed legit on the surface, so I sent a reply asking for further information but being careful not to provide any personal information.      I got back an e-mail stating they would pay $60,000 per annum for working from home helping them with customer service online and over the phones. Moreover, the application just wanted my address, my phone number, my name, gender, and date of birth. They didn't ask for a Social Security #, a bank routing #, etc.      However, I was told by Erika Friske, who claims to be one of their managers, that the website for the company is www.abctransportsa.com, and when I go there, it's a dead website. Moreover, when I try to find information on them via a web search, all I get is hits about a "ABC Transporter protein" involved in vitamin B12 metabolism. When I exclude these kinds of hits from the search, I get 3 hits: 1 is the dead website, 1 is a hit about a Nigerian bus line, and the other is a dead file.      So I'm extremely dubious about this company. I am curious, therefore, to know if anyone else out there has had any dealings with "ABC Transport SA". If so, did they attempt to phish you for information? Did they end up being a legitimate, LEGAL, paying company, or did they just rip you off?      Thanks for any light you can shed and God bless you!</detail>

      <title>If the Vatican declared all Catholics are citizens, would Catholics be forbidden from the US presidency?</title>
      <detail>Let's say Pope Benedict were to proclaim that every person born of a Catholic, no matter where he may be born, is a natural-born citizen of the Vatican. Let's say a child born in the USA to Catholic parents wants to run for president 35+ years later, is he eligible by the same standard we hold Obama to?   Here's the situation: Obama was born in Hawai'i, but under British law, he was a British citizen by birth; some argue that because he was born with dual citizenship, he is ineligible. What if the Vatican set up the aforementioned scenario? Would then Catholics be ineligible for the presidency as they were born with citizenship not only here, but of another country, like Obama?   So, if a country considers the foreign born to be its natural born citizens, even if that person has not had family living in that foreign country for five generations, he is ineligible to be president b/c he's born a citizen of another nation?</detail>

      <title>Beginning Kayaker. What kind of Kayak should I look into?</title>
      <detail>I'm most concerned with construction vs Price. It seems like the only cheap ones are made entirely out of rubber. Is 33 mil thick rubber durable enough for a kayak? I saw some more expensive ones that were a hard plastic bottom and inflatable tops. Is there any that are entirely hard material? What are your views on each of these types and my situation?</detail>

        <answer>Take a look at the Old Town Otter. Light enough for one person to carry (about 40 lbs.), stable, inexpensive and practically indestructible.  http://www.epinions.com/review/Old_Town_...</answer>
        <answer>I was new to kayaking in May and after researching I bought an Old Town Otter from Bass Pro for $249.  It is an all plastic sit-in kayak that tracks pretty well and is stable.  If you want something bigger, look at the Loon.    Look at www.paddling.net for all the kayak reviews you could want.  The product reviews link is in the left column 3/4's down the page.    P.S.- Alot of your decision depends on what you plan to use it for.  The Otter is a flat-water kayak (lakes and class I/II rivers).  ...</answer>
        <answer>First, buy some instruction. Most schools will supply all equipment except clothing. You can't go wrong with a 13/14 foot whitewater fiberglass/resin kayak to start with. Rubber or soft plastic kayaks are 'toys'.  A decked kayak allows you to paddle 'dry' and stay warm. Of course you must stay upright!</answer>

      <title>Do the Al Gore blind followers know what the APS is?</title>
      <detail>The American Physical Society, an organization representing nearly *50,000* physicists, has reversed its stance on climate change and is now proclaiming that many of its members disbelieve in human-induced global warming.  The APS is also sponsoring public debate on the validity of global warming science.  The leadership of the society had previously called the evidence for global warming "incontrovertible."    Holy Cr@p! What are the Al Gore Fools going to use as an excuse now?    Here is a link to the entire article    http://www.dailytech.com/Myth+of+Consens...</detail>

        <answer>LOL.  Perhaps a blog by Michael Asher isn't "fact-checked" quite as thoroughly as you assumed ;-)    Here's what the APS really says about global warming:  http://www.aps.org/policy/statements/07_...

        <answer>Sure I know who they are.  And I know they haven't changed (much less reversed) their position that global warming is real, and mostly caused by us.  The dailytech article is utter nonsense.    The Science and Policy Forum of the APS (one of 39 subgroups) has an online newsletter.  The editor of the newsletter decided it would be fun to publish a "debate" about global warming.  He asked a noted "skeptic" and some global warming scientists to write a letter, each explaining their position.  The l...</answer>
        <answer>Al Gore has nothing to do with Global Warming.  He's just a messenger who came after 35 years of research and before much of the better research.  Nobody who knows anything about Al Gore cites him, he is just a messenger.  The research is there with or without him.</answer>
        <answer>Yes. I do know who they are and no, they have not reversed its stance on climate change. Go to their site and they say     'APS Climate Change Statement    APS Position Remains Unchanged    The American Physical Society reaffirms the following position on climate change, adopted by its governing body, the APS Council, on November 18, 2007:    "Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the Earth's climate."

        <answer>I was a Teller for Fleet before it became Bank of America several years ago.  Its a great environment and most are part-time or seasonal employees.  The Bank typically wants good customer service skills and basic math ability, and business attire  - and they will put you through the 2-week training program (which is often paid).  Just pick a local bank and check out the opportunities on their website. This is also a good entry-level position into branch management later on if you are interested.</answer>
        <answer>Yes. You can be a part time teller; in fact a lot if tellers are. I don't think you need any schooling. Just good people skills and fast a the 9 pad number keys. If you want to take classes i don't know of any that benefit a teller position.</answer>
        <answer>Yes, there is.  My friend worked as a bank teller while she was still in college.  She only worked a few days a week so I know she wasn't full-time.  I also worked full-time for the same bank's national call center for a while.  Some of my co-workers there were part-time.

      <answers>
        <answer>A wedding ceremony cannot be performed ANYPLACE without a VALID marriage license.     Before you make any plans find out what the rules and regulations are for California because each state is different.    I applaud your common sense to have a ceremony performed in the US before your "out of the country" ceremony.  You will not regret taking this precautionary legal measure.    Answered by:  A Certified wedding specialist / A Professional bridal consultant / A Wedding ceremony officiant</answer>
        <answer>Why are you going to do the marriage in LA first? Why not just do the real thing in Mexico? You only have to get your marriage licence at home and make sure they know you're getting married abroad. This is totally legal and people do it all the time! You'll still be considered legally married in the US.</answer>
        <answer>you have to get a marriage license first. before you can get married in California. if you can get your license in LA county you can always go to San Diego county and get one there. the is a office in San Marcos. you can go in get the license and get married all in the same trip. there is no wait time to get married. the only thing you Will have to wait for is your copy of the marriage certificate (7-10 days) . once you have that done you can go to Mexico and have your ceremony. best of luck!!!</answer>
        <answer>Why can't you just have the whole thing in Mexico? If you have your valid US marriage license, you should be able to go to the Custom's house there to have it validated for a ceremony in Mexico. You have to have a marriage license to be married, and you have to have it first. Most states have at least a 24 turn around period from the day you apply for the license until the time you can pick it up.

        <answer>I've had this happen on a chevy with just the Brake light. A sensor in the combination valve might have set off the warning lamp.  Sometimes after brake work, the lines are off balance and the car computer thinks you have lost pressure in one of your brake systems.  Sometimes its a matter of stepping on the brake, starting the car, and then release and re-apply the brake pedal.  Doing so releases any pressure, and then resets the metering pin in the system.  Any manual is going to tell you to co...</answer>

There has been a lot of chatter about the cost of these cells ranging from about that of a gasoline to 10x the cost.  Anyone have a link that says for sure?

        <answer>I haven't seen any reports of what the fuel cell costs but you can bet its probably far more expensive than anything else they are building.    Pretty much Honda is willing to lose huge amounts of money on each of these cars they make because its a research project.  These people are just doing Honda's testing for them.

        <answer>We can only go by what similar cars were projected to cost.  One rumor mill had a hollywood star buying one for over $100,000.  Honda won't say either, why should they?  Toyota has a Fuel Cell car for lease in Japan, see below.  I can't believe the cost, it says $7,684 / month.  I have to believe that may be per year.

      <title>What are your thoughts of the ECB to withdraw tour VS S.L. for West Indies 2009?</title>
      <detail>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has invited West Indies to replace Sri Lanka in a tour of England next April and May for a test series and one-day internationals 2009.      This is an great final decison from ECB to tour West Indies since, SL cricketers have an contract to play for the I.P.L. schedule since, England wants to play politics VS Zimbabwe instead of playing cricket with Zimbabwe.      What are your thoughts of ECB to withdraw tour VS S.L. &amp; to host VS West Indies 2009?      I say its the right decison &amp; great for SL cricketers to get better experienc for the 20-20 IPL overs.</detail>

        <answer>Great theing for SL cricket since had they called it off rather than postphone it then SL team wouldn't have played in England till 2011, which is a long way away.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  But i personally would have liked to see Sanga Mahela Murali Mendis vassy playing in England rather than the IPL cause i love test cricket...&lt;br&gt;  and last time we drew the test series who knows maybe we could have won it this time round with M&amp;M...... :)&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  And i'm very happy Arjuna is standing up against the ultim...</answer>
        <answer>I can't believe that SL put the IPL before national commitments, i expected better from international cricketers.&lt;br&gt;  Anyway, it a great decision from ECB. Whats the point in playing a sub-standard SL side, esp in the lead up to the Ashes&lt;br&gt;  West Indies would provide a far better challenge for England so good on the ECB</answer>
        <answer>correct decision by the ECB&lt;br&gt;  while i have no argument with the sri lankan players going after the money in india (they are not paid well by international standards) but on the other hand i wonder where sri lankan cricket is going after this crop of players retire because if they keep pulling out of tours the younger players will get no international exposure &lt;br&gt;  </answer>
        <answer>I think it is the right decision to withdraw tour vs SL for WI in 2009.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The ECB wanted to show SL that they can still play cricket even if SL withdraw their tour due to IPL. &lt;br&gt;  It will also help SL cricketers to get better experience for the 20-20 IPL tournament.</answer>
        <answer>I think it is a great decision. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If star players are missing from the side the interest would be lost in the match.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I think they have done right in hosting west indies instead of Sri lanka</answer>

        <answer>yes it's possible, would take along time, but nothing ventured nothing gained. Assuming you are legal age to leave, not a minor running away.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  However me and a ran away at the age of `14 and and made it too states down from michigan before getting arrested on the expressway, I'm 36 now (long time ago). I'm a gemini so I like to do things spur of the Moment without thinking first.</answer>
        <answer>Yes, but you will have to keep your overhead to a minimum.  If you walk, just remember how long it took the pioneers to get across. And they didn't do this in the winter and it still took months.  There are many ways to get across the country and they are all dangerous. The easiest and safest would be a "ride share", where you go on-line and see if someone wants assistance driving across the states.</answer>
        <answer>no, i never did. im a female and if i did that i would buy a gun first, a knife, and learn karate before i do that. im paranoid so i dont trust any stranger. especially being a girl you have to be extra careful. but bad things happen to guys too. why would you want to hitchhike? its possible to hitchhike there but you cant trust anyone on the road. why dont you take a bus,tain, or airplane instead? are you homeless or running away from something? are you a fugitive? lol. just wondering...</answer>
        <answer>i have 2 friends that went from Vancouver Canada to PEI Canada. it took 3 weeks and they spent less than $250. they are certainly not lacking for cash but they did it as an adventure. they had people buy them meals, put them up in motels, and offered them money.&lt;br&gt;  that was Canada, i'm not sure about the US and how people treat travelers.</answer>

      <title>Do Govt. Contractors (Lockheed, Northrop Grumman,ILEX) get relocation packages? If so what do they entail?</title>
      <detail>My husband is going for an interview out of state next week. This job is basically his, the interview is a technicality.  Anyway, he will be going from a fairly important position (not as a manager though) to another equally if not more important position at an entirely different company.  We will be having to move out of state if he agrees to take the position; Baltimore&amp; North Carolina are the most likely places we will move. We currently live in Texas.    I was wondering if companies such as these provide relocation packages? We will be leaving about a month before our lease is up &amp; may not get our deposit back. The houseing in the Baltimore area is 2.5 times as expensive as it is here in Texas &amp; we will need about $5000 up front just to rent a decent home there. Plus another $1000 for a uhaul. We don't have that kind of money to just drop.. We'd have to starve for a month to come up with it. So we are hoping for a relocation package.    Do they offer them? What is a standard package?</detail>

        <answer>I can tell you that if you are a new hire for the Federal government (not a contractor), they generally do NOT pay for your relocation as a new hire unless you're very high up (upper management, SES positions), competition for people with your skills is fierce (e.g., RNs), or the job location is generally undesirable.    As for a government contractor...if it is the company's standard practice to offer relocation benefits to new hires, they will tell him so in his interview.  The terms of the pa...</answer>

      <title>Questions About the Kronwall hit and Game in General?</title>
      <detail>Okay so I just saw the hit and why on Earth was Kronwall ejected? He didn't leave his feet, he just happened to hit a guy a little too hard. The replay showed that neither of the referees had the arms up to signal a penalty after the hit. So what should have been a penalty was the Chicago players cross-checking and hitting Kronwall after the play (technically). By the way props to Chicago players, lets start a fight around a guy knocked out on the ice. I regrees. I just read online that neither ref was going to signal a penalty, however, DAN O'HALLORAN (yes red wings fans the guy who has been haunting you for years; he was shot in Detroit in the 80's and has held a grudge ever since) decided to give Kronwall a 5 minute major and a game misconduct. My other question is do you think Chicago has a shot in this series? I really do think that the refs handed them this game and had it not been for poor officiating, well lets just say I like Detroit's chances. My prediction: Detroit in 5. Feel free to add yours!</detail>
      <category>Sports;Hockey</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The 5 minute major combined with the double minor to Cleary for highsticking (warranted), plus the weak hold to Ericsson right after the major just made it so the Wings couldn't get their game started until half way through the second period.  That plus the loss of Kronwall was pretty tough though.  He eats up a lot of minutes for the Wings.  The Wings played good enough to win, but they still commit way too many turnovers.  While yes, I do think the Wings would have won the game if that Kronwal...</answer>
        <answer>The Wings have never been ones to really start the fights [although they have started a few] but I think poor offciating and favortism is in all sports, and I think the Detroit teams usally get the raw end of things Maybe they should start penalizing the officials when a review is done and they have made the wrong call or no call someone should be reviewing these officials in all sports and weeding out the bad ones   OH wait then we would have to play without officials</answer>
        <answer>Clean, legal hit. No penalty warranted. The call was horrible.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Sure, the Hawks have a shot. I'm a longtime Wings fan, but I never sell the opposition short. Chicago always plays the Wings tough during the regular season. I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see this series go to 6 or maybe even 7 games.</answer>
        <answer>even the announcers said it was a clean hit. who have been doing broadcasts and hockey their whole lives. and they are sometimes the most biased people. even pat foley, chicago analyst, would've called it clean</answer>
        <answer>hit to the head. I bet babooncock put him up to it. the refs did kronwell a favor by getting him off the ice, as the game was going to get out od hand if they hadn't. good call.</answer>

      <category>Business &amp; Finance;Personal Finance</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The checking account itself is fine.     B of A sucks.     They have an annoying habit of intense marketing to their customers. Phone, mail, ads on the website, etc. Credit fraud protection, life insurance -- you name it, they sell it. After awhile it gets really annoying, especially the phone calls.</answer>
        <answer>Most checking accounts are pretty much the same.  Ditch their credit card though..they will raise your rate without notice for no reason and as stated...sell your information so you will be bombarded with solicitations.</answer>
        <answer>I live in Charlotte by the way, home of the B of A AND Wachovia corporate headquarters. I have a Wachovia account. My wife has a Bank of America account.     I'm with one of the other answerers. B of A tends to want to market products through phone calls. Let me recommend Wachovia. It has a higher customer satisfaction rating, and also offers free checking account options.</answer>
        <answer>I enjoy my account very much.  I also have a savings account with them that I use to help automate many personal goals i have financially.  The website is first rate.  I chose B of A primarily because Consumer Reports rated them  1, by far.    I have experienced the marketing/sales calls others users have mentioned.</answer>
        <answer>I have bank of america as well and I have had no problem with my checking or savings acct.  I do agree that they call a lot and at least once or twice a week I get junk mail from them about insurance or something.  Its frustrating too because I will even go to the drive thru and they try to sell stuff to me through the drive thru.  I would rather not have that but as for as the accounts go I have had no problem with them.</answer>

      <title>Marvelous Marvin Hagler vs Sugar Ray Robinson (both prime)?</title>
      <detail>a battle of the middleweight kings, what a sweet fight this would be, who would win and why?</detail>
      <category>Sports;Boxing</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>As great as Hagler was I think that he is a tad overrated, if he was taken to a close decision by Roberto Duran and beaten, no matter how controversially, by Sugar Ray Leonard imagine what Robinson would do. Robinson is often called the greatest p4p boxer for a reason. At middleweight he was beatable, towards the end of his career he suffered the bulk of his losses at the weight, however he was still a great boxer. The 30 year old middleweight Robinson was like the 30 year old middleweight Leona...</answer>
        <answer>Sugar Ray Robinson is #1 on all of the all-time lists. Marvin Hagler was great and looked phenomenal against Sugar Ray Leonard, but Sugar Ray Robinson is in his own league. They are both kings, too good and different to compare. But if I had to pick one, Sugar Ray Robinson wins via TKO in the first 10 rounds.</answer>
        <answer>Over 15 rounds Hagler wins this fight either on a decision or stoppage in the late rounds.&lt;br&gt;Robinson was a great welterweight, and only a very good middleweight.&lt;br&gt;He was not in his prime when he fought at middleweight.&lt;br&gt;At 147 Robinson would win, but the question was at 160, and Robinson was not at his prime at that weight or age.</answer>
        <answer>Sugar Ray was on another level when he was in his prime.  At 140 he could have whooped a Hagler that had almost 20 pounds on him.  He was too quick.  He would have opened Hagler up like it was Christmas morning, hurt him, then put him down in round 3.  Hagler was a bad dude, but Sugar Ray Robinson was the baddest ever.</answer>

At an independent locus, gene D produces yellow pigment if the genotype is D, but no pigment is produced when the genotype is dd. Production of both pigments results in brown coat color. If neither pigment is produced, coat color is cream. A third independently assorting gene involved in determination of coat color in rats is the C gene. At this locus, the genotype C - permits expression of pigment from genes B and D. The cc genotype, however, prevents expression of coat color and results in albino rats.

      <title>Could Michael Jordan have had a hang time of 10 seconds? Why or why not?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Science &amp; Mathematics;Physics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>No.  Because gravity is a constant, and if you examine the vertical velocity vectors, you'll see he would have had to jump far higher than a human being is capable of, to be up there for 10 seconds.</answer>
        <answer>Could he have?  I suppose so.  In an open air stadium.  The height of his jump would be about h = 1/2 g(t/2)^2.  (125 meters)    Did he?  No</answer>
        <answer>Well, in order to have a hang time of 10 seconds, he must spend 5 seconds going up and 5 seconds coming down, assuming we do not count any time spent hanging from the basket while physically holding onto it.  To fall under the influence of gravity at the surface of the Earth for 5 seconds, one must fall through a distance of y = 0.5*gt^2 = 0.5(9.8 m/s^2)(5 s)^2 = 0.5*9.8*25 = 122.5 m, which is longer than the length of a football field.  Clearly, Michael Jordan does not jump this high into the a...</answer>
        <answer>IMPOSSIBLE..UNLESS HE WAS DUNKING ON THE MOON</answer>
        <answer>Definitely not.    Once he jumps, gravity is the only force acting on him.   The time it takes him to reach his highest point on the way up must equal the time it takes him to come back down, so 5 seconds.    The distance travelled under this situation is calculated using the equation:    distance = 0.5 x acceleration x time^2    acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s^2, so we have    distance = 0.5 x 10 x 5^2 = 125m    No way is he able to jump that high!</answer>

        <answer>You're in luck if you want an MIT education without the hassle of application interviews and the crippling tuition debt. MIT is the home of open courseware, a free online version of college where books, assignments, exams, and even lectures are distributed free of charge, with no strings attached. I've pasted the link below.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  You can also check out most other colleges' websites; they often post the syllabus for any course right on the course page, or on the personal web page of the pro...</answer>

      <category>Sports;Basketball</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Talent-wise Brevin Knight is a better player, but he did not make quite an impact in Clippers last season - to take over the role of veteran leadership as left by Sam Cassell. Plus he has always been the smallest player on the floor who would face more nightmare-like mismatches as time goes by. Therefore, a trade is not too surprising at all.    Jason Hart is used to be the default backup of Deron Williams, but obviously Ronnie Price is pushing him very hard for PG role in 2nd string, and it bec...</answer>

        <answer>Yeah...it doesnt really make any sense for the clippers.</answer>
        <answer>Its a fair trade. They're both back-up PGs, personally i like Knight better than Hart, but seems to me that the Clippers think otherwise. However, no matter what, their talents are similar, back-up PGs, Knight could be a starter if pressured (Charlotte 04-06)</answer>

      <detail>i read this book earlier this year.  it was clearly the best book i've read to date this year (i average about 6 books/week).      The book is based on a real life courtroom battle in the antebellum south (usa) regarding a case of mistaken identity involving a white slave.  it is one of the few books i've read in the last year that addresses the issues of white slaves and slave owners who were 'free men of color' (i.e. black)     the author of the book is australian.  scholarly citations are noted throughout the book.    and, it read like a great court-room drama.    anybody read it?  i'd like to hear what other people thought.    </detail>

As horrifying as slavery is it makes you think about the fact that there must have been people who managed to fall into slavery somehow and became trapped.  Not to mention the fact that the systematic abuse of women in slavery produced slaves who were as white as the owners who were family.  </answer>

      <detail>Would one go to hell if you were born an illegitimate child, but were later baptised?</detail>
      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Religion &amp; Spirituality</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>No. Being baptised is being born again through the Holy Spirit of God. No young child will go to Hell because they cannot be accountable for their sin because they don't understand yet. When baptised, the human is a new creation of God, with His Spirit.</answer>
        <answer>Without a doubt as well as your next nine generations.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  " A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD. " (Deuteronomy 23:2)</answer>
        <answer>Being born illegitimate is not a sin of that child but of the parents, being baptized is a act of man that won't merit heaven. Only accepting Jesus as your savior and His blood will be the payment that will let you into heaven,</answer>
        <answer>Ephesians 2:8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</answer>
        <answer>The bible does not teach that there is a hell in which sinners burn in. In Ecc9:5 , 10 it says: "The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead they are conscious of nothing at all... All that your hand finds to do, do it with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going."&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;   It is clear than that if the dead are aware of nothing they can feel nothing and obviously the point of this so called pla...</answer>

      <title>Why is Google crashing my computer?</title>
      <detail>I have IE 8, and here lately, everytime I go to Google my computer crashes.  Any idea why or how to fix it?    Thanks!</detail>
      <category>Computers &amp; Internet;Internet;Google</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Sort depends upon what "crash" means to you.  Do you get an error message?  Does the machine actually reboot or does the browser just shut down?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Does it happen even if you start Windows in Safe Mode?  When did the problem start?  Have you tried doing a system restore to before the issue began?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  What anti-virus software are you using?</answer>
        <answer>First of all, you shouldn't be using IE. Firefox or Chrome is the way to go.&lt;br&gt;  Secondly, sounds like you have a pretty crappy computer. I'm guessing it does this because your CPU is working at 100%  and can't handle anything else, or you don't have enough RAM. Either way, try closing some of the programs or processes that aren't necessary from the Task Manager. Hold Ctrl + Shift + Esc.</answer>

        <answer>No! now your insulting my pig☺☺.</answer>
        <answer>No.  Actually that isn't a bacon milkshake...it's a bacon "flavored" milkshake, and NOTHING bacon flavored ever really tastes like bacon.</answer>
        <answer>No, why bother?  When I want bacon, I eat a couple strips of bacon.  A bacon milkshake would be high in so much saturated fat and stuff, just wouldn't be worth it, plus all the trouble and cost.</answer>
        <answer>Not intentionally - a 24 oz large bacon milkshake adds a whopping 1081 calories and 54 grams of fat to your meal.  Why not just apply it directly to my thighs!</answer>
        <answer>Gladys covered it, more calories than I eat all day.  I wouldn't mind tasting it though.  I love bacon.  I tasted a bacon cupcake once and it was wonderful.</answer>

        <answer>Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources - Martin Lings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sealed Nectar - Safi-ur-Rehman Mubarakpurika (OIC approved) - therefore perphaps making it the "most reliable". Personally, it has a slight Salafi overtone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haykal is also quite good.</answer>
        <answer>Try "what everyone needs to know about Islam" by John Esposito. it's short and to the point about Islam in general but has enough detail to get you understanding the next book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The 100" by Micheal h.Hart. Mohammed(pbuh) is the most influential man to ever live according to him and not only on the military and religious levels - but the secular and legal levels too.</answer>
        <answer>I think the best one for beginners is probably Martin Lings book, "Muhammad:  His Life Based on the Earliest Sources."  -Although I wouldn't suggest reading ANY book of seerah without a scholar around who can explain to you certain issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I would suggest Muhammad Husayn Haykals book "The Life of Muhammad"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both are in clear, eloquent English and are very detailed without being too long or boring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Salaam/Peace.</answer>

      <title>Is India A Democracy Or A Congress Party Dictatorship?</title>
      <detail>A democracy is a system whereby the consent of the people decides the ruling government.....How can a country which has had the same party for 98% of the time be considered to a democracy?    In a democracy, there is free speech for the people to express themselves - In India whoever criticises Islam gets a fatwa or whoever criticises Gandhi gets beatings.    In a democracy there is a free press that is independent of the goverment and imparts free and fair and unbias news reports - In India the press is extremely bias and is always favours the Congress party and communists and marxists and always unjustly criticises the BJP. In part this is due to the fact that the Indian media is run by psuedo seculars who are anti-Hindu as well as the fact that it is funded by Christian organisations.    In a democracy there is no limits to education - whereas in India the Congress party deliberatly keep the populace illiterate in order to stay in power...Moreover Hindu educational institutions are not permitted whereas Christian schools are allowed as are Islamic madrasas that preach extremism.....</detail>

        <answer>its normal for an app to have bugs, especially on a new system like the 4s. Go on the app's page in the apple store and click "report a problem". select "report a bug" and then describe the problem and send it. They usually update it and fix bugs like that in a week or so, though it depends on the app.</answer>

        <answer>Probably - but why on earth would you get one?  A free puppy won't be up to date on shots, altered, deflead, dewormed, etc.  Why not go to a shelter and adopt one?  It's only cost you a $100 or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think that's a lot of money?  Then the several hundred you'll need on getting those things done on a "free" puppy you certainly won't be able to afford.</answer>

      <category>Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones &amp; Plans</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>You don't have to provide an email/password but it's good to create an account so that your bookmarks get stored.  As far as I know you can bookmark songs from the android app but you have to go to the website (or iPhone app) to access your bookmarks.  Go to www.pandora.com and use the forgot password link, if you have an account you should be able to sign in and see your bookmarks, if you never created an account, your bookmarks may be lost.</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>from my understanding these descriptors are for personality types.    For example, Alpha (the first letter in the greek alphabet) are usually dominant, aggressive, and go for what they want.  They also generally don't mind saying what is on their mind.  This is basically extroverts who like to be the leader and have their way.    Betas are the opposite of Alphas.  They are basically introverted, as they do not readily speak their minds and do not speak up unless ordered to (usually by an Alpha)....</answer>
        <answer>Depends on your context.    In a dog/wolf pack, the alpha of course is the leader of the pack. The other animals will follow. The alpha eats first, gets first pick of beds at night, first pick of mates, etc. Betas are typically the less-powerful. They're submissive to alphas, they'll wait to eat, etc. Omegas are afraid of and submissive to EVERYTHING!!      In human sociey, alpha males are the guys we all drool over- celebrities, athletes, millionaires, etc. They're the cream of the crop, and th...</answer>
        <answer>Alpha is a top dog, Beta are technically droids, and Omega are the lower of the 3    think of it like this  Alpha = Hottest guy you  know  Beta = most relationship qualified you know  Omega = the dork that helps you with your homework (but will end up rich)</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>My friend, the riding public here in New York City has a love-hate relationship with the MTA. Everything from cut back in service to fare and toll increase, New Yorker love to complain about the MTA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems that the folks that run the transit agency, which is always catch strapped, never seem to get their act together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good luck</answer>
        <answer>The MTA is corrupt, run by halfwits, totally incompetent, was just ruled in violation of the U.S Constitution by a federal court for trying to use censorship on political advertising, and probably infiltrated by the Taliban or some other anti-American organization.  But of course, I am one of their admirers, always ready to find an excuse for their malpractice.  You need to get someone who hates them to tell you what's really wrong.</answer>
        <answer>The MTA is far from perfect, but they take on a very challenging task of getting a couple of million people to their destinations on time every day and do it well.</answer>

For about a year he paid the money directly into my account, sometimes it would be less, and i would have to call him to see why..it has become a headache. he told me he had financial problems and the full amount would be there the following month. my daughter just turn two, and for the last six month i've only gotten about $200?? and somtimes nothing.  Thur all this I'm now married to a service member in the navy, my husband pays for my daughters medical care, and has been helping me take of her.  my plan was to go to the JAG office and seek legal matters. Ive been way to nice with him... I always try to give him chances cause i know he could get into alot of trouble. So I just want to know what are the steps??

        <answer>I wouldn't waste my time going to JAG.  It is not the function or responsibility of JAG to create child support orders particularly when the parents neglected to get a child support order entered.  And there is no need to involve the Marine Corps with your personal matters.  Obviously your verbal agreement isn't working any more.  You need to get an order from a court.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I would file a petition for child support in your local family court.  (Found in your County Superior Courthouse.) ...</answer>

      <title>Will the UN or NATO ever take military action against Israel?</title>
      <detail>for it's continued illegal occupation of the West Bank and Gaza</detail>
      <category>News &amp; Events;Current Events</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Israel has done a lot more really bad things than just that.  And the UN has tried to take action against Israel before and failed (In the recent Israeli-Lebanon war Israel actually targetted some UN peacekeepers in Lebanon).</answer>
        <answer>The UN and NATO never take action the US does. The UN and NATO are dysfunctional organizations with no real force to impose their threats.</answer>
        <answer>No, because Israel has too much influence over US politics. The US wouldn't allow it.    Israel is in breach of a host of UN resolutions and has a habit of invading its neighbours, it could easily be termed a 'rogue state'. Countries have been invaded and destroyed for the same, (Iraq, for example).</answer>
        <answer>the US is bigger than the UN...didn't you learn anything when we invaded Iraq?...plus we get a hard on by providing Israel with the sickest military we can (or can't) afford.  Since bush took office in 2000, we have given, yes i said given - as in a grant - over $18 billion strictly for their military...check out this website</answer>
        <answer>Israel can and does get away with murder knowing it can hide behind the skirts of the US. Until America stops its veto on all anti Israeli resolutions and stops giving millions of dollars in aid to Israel the UN 's hands are tied. One day the ordinary American people will realise that they cannot afford to feed themselves let alone give their hard earned cash to these greedy Jews in Israel. Now the recession has started this may happen sooner rather than later.</answer>

        <answer>No, simply because nobody would buy it.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Alot of computer geeks like you and me have come to think that the average computer user is smarter than what they really are.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Most of the population is quite clueless about OSes and stuff. Linux simply isn't user friendly enough for the majority to buy or download it. (Linux can acctually be bought for 12 bucks instead of downloads...Pfft, cheapskates...)</answer>
        <answer>Maybe, Maybe not. A lot of companies want you to BUY their software instead of a freeware opensourced one. &lt;br&gt;  Espically microsoft.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  And sometimes people don't think twice when it comes to spending well known software.  People buy microsoft office because they are more familair with it (an preinstalled) and most likely have never heard of openoffice&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  It would be helpful if we can try other and possibly more efficient methods of getting people to know about several open sour...</answer>

      <title>Are the Spurs the Cavaliers of 2011?</title>
      <detail>That past couple of years the Cavs were the number one seed in the east(and the league) and yet they were eliminated by teams that nobody thought would beat them.. Now the Spurs being number one in the west get knocked out by the grizzlies.. what are your thoughts</detail>
      <category>Sports;Basketball</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Definitely.. i'm pretty sure the Spurs fans feel the same way right now that the Cavs fans did the passed two years.. when you are number one people expect big things and when you are eliminated by a team that clearly didn't try as hard as you did in the regular season.. it really crushes the fans hopes.. so yea it is a great comparison.. it has nothing to do with lebron james carrying the cavaliers or the spurs being well rounded.. they are in similar situations..</answer>
        <answer>at least the cavs made the second round conference finals the 2 years before lbj left.</answer>
        <answer>Yes.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  That and when the era fades away, fans will too.</answer>
        <answer>Yes. Good observation.&lt;br&gt;  Being the best team on Earth in February means what again ?  Not much, as it turns out.</answer>

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>News &amp; Events;Current Events</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>As you probably don't purchase too much military hardware directly then the only way you can have an influence at all is by reducing the flow of your funds that go to them via the government. To do that you would have to pay less direct and indirect tax. The only way to achieve that is to consume less and consuming less strikes at the heart of the problem. With reduced consumption comes reduced competition for resources and reduced motivation for war. In other words you got no chance.</answer>
        <answer>Join the Army</answer>
        <answer>You might be able to relocate to a country with a much reduced military budget.  If you still have an income there, the taxes would be less likely to support an arms purchase.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Not a boycott, but you might be able to get control of the company(ies) by spreading rumors and buying / selling equity.</answer>

        <answer>More detail would help to know what to tell you. You'd be best off to list it with an agent in the area where the land is and then let them handle where they advertise it. If you live in the US, then I'd suggest finding out what local agents are with companies who also have offices where you live. That way you can do paperwork and so on through the office near where you live.</answer>

      <detail>The McCain campaign states that they agree with the Obama campaign.      According to precedent set and maintained by the National Endowment of the Arts and other cultural foundations, since data indicates that many Americans find this work of free artistic expression to be "offensive," yea, even "tasteless," this artist's work has, without doubt, earned a place in the finest cultural venues of our country.    Like the artistic greats who brought noble, elevating, culturally-aware creations such as Christian religious symbols covered or submerged in excrement, the artist who expressed their impressions through the cover of the New Yorker should be supported and promoted by our free-thinking enemies of censorship in the world of American and international art and culture in their tireless and conscientious efforts to present the best that human creativity can offer to all of us.

      <detail>I am going to Oslo and Stockholm in April. I have one day off and I want to visit another city in either Norway or outside. What city would you recommend: Copengahen, Trondheim, Tomso, Alesund, another? and why?</detail>
      <category>Travel;Europe (Continental);Denmark</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I would normally say Copenhagen, but one day really isn't enough. Any of those cities will require a flight from either Oslo or Stockholm, and I can't imagine flying somewhere just for a day. Why not find somewhere closer to Stockholm or Oslo, like a boat cruise on the archipelago from Stockholm, or the Norway in a Nutshell tour from Oslo</answer>
        <answer>Definitively Copenhagen. It is a must, when you are in Scandinavia.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Have been all of the above mentioned places, and if it is only one day, i would prefer to go to a place that offers a variety of things to do and see.&lt;br&gt;  Stockholm is my favorite place in Sweden, and like Copenhagen it is also a mix of new and old. But Copenhagen is my definite favorite.    &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I think Norway is great, but it is the nature that attracts me. A boat trip through  the fjords is perfect, but you...</answer>
        <answer>Copengahen, no doubt about it. As opposed to the other three places Copengahen is a well known capital city. It is also conveniently located on the way in between Oslo and Stockholm. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  There are so many things to see and do. Since you have only one day take my advice and do not waste time and money on the Tivoli Gardens.</answer>

        <answer>Whichever is closer to where you work.  Commuting in the L.A. area is legendarily brutal.</answer>
        <answer>Orange County, without a doubt.  More modern (newer), somewhat lower crime rates, slightly lower sales tax, a more conservative, less radical government, overall better school systems, overall better roads, etc. I could go on, and on. and on</answer>
        <answer>I much prefer LA County. The OC just isn't my type of place. I haven't lived in the OC, but I have friends that do, and I spend vacation time every year at the Surf &amp; Sand in Laguna, and I just really don't like the vibe I get down there. It really is an individual thing. I think some of the OC just feels too sterile to me, and not permanent.

        <answer>OC is definitely better. Newer, cleaner, wider roads, less crime overall. I've lived in both.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If I could afford to live in Irvine or one of the other south county cities, I would. But Brea is QUITE nice.</answer>
        <answer>well in my opinion, "best" is wideley based on how safe an area is. both places are good depending on the area. id say overall though, oc is better. the reason i say that is because overall it has safer areas than LA county and 75% of OC is considered middle class or higher as oppose less than 50% in LA county. but with that said, LA county is so big that there are plenty of safe areas to live in. that is, if you can afford them. whether you live in OC or LA county, you this is definetely an are...</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>The only advice i have is that you get better quality appliances. Also to get a more upgraded game card to help with loading lag.</answer>
        <answer>If its lag when loading not graphics lag you need to do two things.  Make sure your hard drive is in good order, free up as much space on it as possible and defrag it.  Next buy more system memory, this helps the games buffer the sound to ram rather than the hard drive.    But if its more serious than that you may need a graphics card update etc too.</answer>

        <answer>There are 2 types of anti-malaria pills to choose from. One is for normal use and the other type is for G6PD-deficiency.people.    So choose the one that you can take. You will need to start on your immunity about a week before going there and continue for a week after your return. Check with your family doctor on this.</answer>
        <answer>I personally wouldnt take malaria tablets again.  Had them for a holiday once and had to stop taking them, they made me feel ill and was ruining my hoilday.  Feeling ill on them is a side effect.  I was fine without them.  This was Thailand I went to.</answer>
        <answer>Not neccessary. I go there for business occassioanlly and most travelers do not take them for Vietnam.  Very rare to get it - not worth the hassle.  Only if you plan to spend weeks in the jungle away from civilization is it worth it.  In the rare case you actually got malaria - there are plenty of anti-malaria remedies at the hospitals especially if it is treated quickly.</answer>

      <title>Who do most folks on Cape Breton Island act like they're not Nova Scotian?</title>
      <detail>Here in Winnipeg, we don't get many tourists, I'm not going to lie. So I may not have the best idea of what Cape Breton islanders are like, but all of the ones I've met have been very low key about the fact they are from Nova Scotia. I ask them where they're from, and they say the maritimes, and when I ask where? They always say "Cape Breton". Once I even asked one what province he was from and he replied, "Cape Breton". That isn't one of the 10 provinces! Hate to say it, but culturally there doesn't seem to be much difference between Cape Breton islanders and peninsular Nova Scotians. Your economies are the same really, agriculture, tourism and mining.  Also, something we all have in common here in Canada, besides maybe Alberta or to some extent Saskatchewan, is that our economies are pretty slow right now. Why do you want to be so autonomous from the rest of Nova Scotia?</detail>

        <answer>Geography &amp; history play a strong part in a region's identity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being on an island may do that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newfoundland: They would say they're Newfoundlanders first &amp; Canadians 2nd. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I've been to the mainland portion (Labrador) &amp; do not call them Newfoundlanders!</answer>
        <answer>You'll find variations of this all over the world. Those who are from the north of England will not like it if you ask if they're from London. People take pride sometimes in their geographical locations, which is more based on what's in their hearts and their family history than government-determined boundaries. Do you really believe that our deep-seated feelings of belonging and local pride should be based on the decisions of some rich government bureaucrats?</answer>
        <answer>Rufus you have discovered a sad truth in this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people come from Cape Breton the rest of the world does not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sad but true&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe if you start here you can learn a little from the people at the end of Nova Scotia  who are proud of their home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jokebuddha.com/Breton" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.jokebuddha.com/Breton&lt;/a&gt;</answer>

        <answer>Not sure why this is of any concern to you. What's the big deal, anyway? People can say whatever they want when asked "where are you from?", and they usually give the name that they think will convey the clearest idea to the asker. You realize that if those same Cape Breton people were in Europe and they were asked where they were from, they'd probably say Canada? Does that mean they are acting like they don't come from North America? If you say you are from Winnipeg, does that mean you are acti...</answer>

        <answer>I remember. I remember seeing Diane Feinstein on TV breaking the news,  I remember the vigils, and I remember Dan White's sorry-*** defense. Twinkies? Bah!    Not being from SF, I was a bit removed but I do know that Moscone was considered a fair and good mayor. Harvey Milk truly broke barriers for the LGBT community when he finally gained a supervisor's seat. He was a true hero.</answer>
        <answer>I remember hearing about the murders, but didn't know about the riots it until I recently saw the movie "The Times of Harvey Milk".   It's a part of history, and unless someone lived during that time, or lived in San Francisco, most people probably don't know much about it.</answer>

Sun spots fol...</answer>
        <answer>I'm afraid Trondheim is a bit too big place for aurora spotting, just because the city lights will disturb the view at least. I recommend you to travel to a place without any city lights in order to be able to view the northern lights properly.</answer>
        <answer>It's possible, but not guaranteed at all. I've seen them as far south as Stockholm and Wyoming in the US, but they are much more likely to be visible above the Arctic Circle. Troms? is a better spot for seeing them.    You will have to get a bit outside Trondheim to have a chance of seeing anything, though. City lights tend to block the view. Daylight hours in mid-February are about 8.00-17.00.</answer>

        <answer>Unless it's a VERY expensive, deluxe rental you're not going to find air conditioned apartments in Seattle.  And you don't really need them, either.  Summers can get hot here but it's generally not very humid so with a few fans it's quite comfortable.      If you REALLY need an A/C you can always buy a window unit one at Lowes or Home Depot.

        <answer>It is really rare to have air con in apartments, as well as houses, in Seattle and the area.  It's just really unnecessary about 95% of the time, so it doesn't usually seem necessary for most people here aside from maybe a few days a year.  In Seattle, the only thing you really have to worry about is having working heat, as you'll likely need that much more.</answer>

When arrived at location to fight the charge, the judge decided to reschedule the hearing on behalf the officer that did not show up. I tired to reason with the judge that this was unfair call and that I have to take another work day off my busy schedule and also lose another day of pay because of this decision you made. I told the judge that was a favoritism call on behalf of this officer and if it was me that missed the hearing i would fall on the charge and pay the maximum fine as stated on the ticket.  Judge said go file a complaint. I had called several government agency to file a complaint a against this judge and found out the place i can do it, is to call into 311. Filing a complaint at 311 did not help at all; as it disappear into a black-hole. Issued 2 complaints with 311 over 1 month span and received no response. I'm so pissed off at this moment.

      <title>Why is NATO only attacking Libya?</title>
      <detail>Why is NATO attacking libya and not countries like Syria and Iran. Iran poses more threat to world security than Libya by far.</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Military</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Because the governments of Syria and Iran are powerful, and wars against them would be long and costly, worse than Iraq.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Ghaddaffi's military is weak. They do not have much defense against air-attacks.</answer>
        <answer>One main reason is: Lybia is between Tunisia and Egypt (the two countries whose revolutions were successful...), and they (specially the US government) want to be there not to give up their control on the middle east....&lt;br&gt; They never think of people of Lybia; they only seek their own benefits in every condition no matter what happens to the rest of the world. Their interference made the situation more complicated for Lybians who started a revolution, they didn't helped at all, and of course th...</answer>
        <answer>I agree with David, Iran is a very powerfull country. If we attack Syria and Iran it may lead to WW3.</answer>
        <answer>Same reason they cried out for America to do something when Iraq invaded Kuwait they get their oil from these countries</answer>
        <answer>1. Libya is getting more media coverage. If they DIDN'T pay attention to it NATO would be considered incompetent or ignorant.&lt;br&gt;  2. NATO can't concentrate on all the problems of the world at once.&lt;br&gt;  3. Libya may not pose a significant threat to world security, but if you've been paying attention to the news, Ghaddafi is killing his people. It's a major human rights issue.</answer>

      <detail>How do you go about learning to read/write it? Usually languages have alphabets but here in this case you have to learn a new crazy character for each and every thing. How do you go about doing that? Is it hard?</detail>
      <category>Travel;Asia Pacific;China</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>At the beginning, it takes guts and determination and lots of memorization.  After a while, the system begins to make sense (the way radicals are used) . . . although at times you just have to guess!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is an excellent site for character learning.

        <answer>Are you already in China? Most expats go to a University in China to learn mandarin. There is beginner level courses. If you are in the Shanghai area, go to Fudan University as it is known to be one of the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are still in the USA planning to go to China, i would start with some type of Rosetta stone program and learn the basics in pronunciation. Learning chinese characters can be tedious. Unless you need to write chinese for a job, then i would stick with speaking and reading</answer>
        <answer>It was hard, at first. But with more effort you put (plus enough determination), you will get the hang of it and soon you'll just read/write the characters naturally. I have a friend who's very diligent and determined to learn Chinese. It took him two years full of bitter and tears, now even Chinese wouldn't know if he's not a local until they meet in person.</answer>

      <title>Why would people go to Hell because they were manipulated?</title>
      <detail>I believe we have a creator. But when, in many religions, people say that if they don't practice the same religion, the go to Hell? Why would a Muslim to a Christian go to Hell if that Muslim was manipulated throughout their life to think what they are doing is the right thing to do. Everybody thinks they are doing the right thing because they were told that by their parents. Their parents by their grandparents, and so on. The Bible says that their is a time in ones life that they will be able to choose what is right and this can alter their outcome of going to Heaven or Hell. But we are God's creations in the Bible. And since the bible says he's perfect, we must be nothing compared to him speaking in terms of intelligence. (don't know if that's spelt right) So we basically are never truely able to choose the right way of life. As sick as it sounds to say, but with this logic backing it up, it doesn't make sense for Osama bin Laden and other people we call evil to go to Hell because they were told throughout their life what was the right thing to do. 9/11 was terrible and sick. But to Osama, he thought that was right. Because of his family telling and manipulating his actions anc morals.</detail>

        <answer>CoolV (previous answer) is right. Google makes money by its Google ads.    When you do a search on sneakers for examples, 8 companies have paid google to be listed on the right.. beside the FREE results for sneakers.     Its good for google (income), and its good for companies because people who are interested in your product are looking at thier link. Its money well spend on thier part.</answer>
        <answer>thats a really good question...i look forward to the responses.</answer>
        <answer>Google can earn money by having people advertize with them.</answer>

It could destroy the rest of us 10 times over without depleting its nuclear arsenal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the advances in technology fewer personnel are needed and as well as being economically ridiculous to increase the military budget, it would also be obscene, considering how many American families are suffering from the fiasco ...</answer>

      <title>Crazy move: Bench Brandon Marshall for Steve Johnson--- PPR league?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Sports;Fantasy Sports</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Pennington is starting this week... I have no clue what that means for Marshall, but as a Marshall owner, it's got me worried... Marshall's been a huge disappointment so far, and he looks to be disgruntled because of the lack of production... a disgruntled Marshall makes for a risky WR... on the other hand, Johnson has been nothing but consistent with Fitz under center... now that Roscoe Parrish is out, Johnson's targets and values go up even more.</answer>
        <answer>I don't think it's crazy at all...Fitzpatrick and Johnson have a very good connection going this year...and a ppr league is even more reason to make that move.  Johnson had 11 receptions last week, and he is on fire!!!  Ride out his hot streak.  Marshall is a beast, but his QB is bad.  His numbers have plummeted this year now that he has Henne throwing him the ball.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I'm wondering if I should bench Boldin to play Johnson this week...how's that for crazy?</answer>

In the office, we were asked to withdraw an amount depending how much we have in our bank account, according to their 'tier table' of Govt taxes we have to pay if we were to get a car or the 'expensive' mattress. If is under other prize categories then they only need record the notes serials.  When i asked to open e prize first, they insist we withdraw the the money first before revealing the prize. Expectedly, after revealing the prize, which is the  'expensive' mattress worth 23K+ which we do not use and don't know how to sell and the person claimed to help us sell then contact us for the profits.  Thereafter we called the 2assistants which they did not pick up. The 'Boss' mentioned arrograntly over the phone say no way we can get back the money and " so what if it's really a scam."  I searched on the internet ALOT of people were scammee by then including Singaporeans. People have reported to Malaysia police nothing is done, and Spore police could not do anything.

        <answer>It is very cold and often the tempreture drops below 0 degrees celcius. It can get as cold as -10-15, so make sure you have the following:    -warm socks (knit wool socks, available at Gap's fall collections most years). You may need to put two pairs on, so buy many  -gloves/mittens (wool or with fleece inside)  -boots (preferably with fur inside. sneakers during winter time can only do in NYC, do not attempt in Moscow!)  -hat (also wool or fleece, but you can survive wearing a baseball cap and ...</answer>

It consists of the Zanzibar Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, 2550 km (1530 mi) off the coast off the mainland. There are numerous small islands and two large ones: Unguja (the main island, informally referred to as "Zanzibar"), and Pemba.

        <answer>Yes, they are now. Previously they were separate, and after the Berlin conference Zanzibar came under British Colonial Rule, and Tanganyika under German Colonial rule (this changed during the first world war and Tanganyika too came under British Rule). Tanganyika got independence in 1961, and Zanzibar in 1963.     In 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar united to form the United  Republic of Tanzania, and this has remained so ever since.</answer>

        <answer>We don't kill people, that's why, I admit it appears like McCain really was the "Manchurian Candidate" considering he seems to have done more than anyone else to get Obama elected.&lt;br&gt;     There will probably be a nuke at some point, our current government is doing everything to allow it to happen, and already has plans in place to assume complete totalitarian rule in the aftermath of such an event.</answer>

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Excuse me, but the 2 things you stqte do not compute. They were furious that it was LEAKED. Read the damn story. And keep in mind that Rummy, who as the Sec of War at the time was responsible for the office in question &amp; thus to blame. Yet he was not fired for over 4 1/2 more years. (read the date on the article). Since Bush was keeping the liar on the payroll (to use your word),  Bush is a liar.  This doesn't address any of the others lies he &amp; his administration have told.</answer>
        <answer>I don't see the connection between Bush's ability to keep the 9th of the 10 Commandments. And Rumsfeld clearing his Pentagon desk.    I'm not a stickler on this Commandment thing as a liberal I believe that any liar that wants to go to hell for lying is free to do so.    Go big Red Go</answer>
        <answer>I will give one example.  Prior to the invasion of Iraq, every time he mentioned Saddam or in Iraq in a speech he also mentioned 9/11, usually in the same paragraph.  Saddam, 9/11.  9/11, Saddam.  This is despite the fact that Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11.  Eventually people would begin to associate the two in their minds.  It's human nature and Bush's people knew that.  It was apparently successful because at the time of the invasion 69% of Americans thought that Saddam was directly invol...</answer>
        <answer>That hardy proves that Bush never lied.  He has other lie producing factories that are still in business, Condi Rice and Cheney are self-contained lie factories.</answer>

        <answer>yeah... its safe.. people live there and its all ok.. about skinheads and other rasista... its mostly in smaler cities, in moskow yu'll see tons of other races... so dnt worry about it :)</answer>
        <answer>Yeah, but nobody can give you 100% guarantee that Moscow is safe to visit.</answer>
        <answer>What colour is your skin?   It is safe if you are white.   If not - just avoid skinheads, sneaking here and there in groups, avoid groups of soccer fans, too.   On the other hand, in Moscow there are almost no dark holes, where drug addicts rob people, like in US.   Tip- don't put your money into your passport, police often ask foreigners to show their documents and they handle money in your passport as a bribe, so they can take it, thinking you're paying them for doing something wrong.</answer>
        <answer>It's safe as long as you take the usual precautions. The Metro is pretty bad for pickpockets, so wear a money belt and be vigilant. Don't go around acting like an obvious tourist (ie. speaking loudly in English, waving your iPod and digital camera around) and you'll be fine.     If you're not white skinned, it's still safe unless you are very unlucky. There is some skinhead activity in Russia, but not really in Moscow. The most you'd get would be some nasty comments and even that's unlikely.</answer>

        <answer>obviously he is infalliable.  if the prophet himself made mistakes, he could've messed up giving the exact words of the quran or his hadeeths would have contradicted the quran. if the prophet made mistakes, we have no perfect model to base our lives on and an excuse to commit certain sins.</answer>
        <answer>Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim     Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah    This is actually a good question, as there are those who make mistakes in this regard.  Prophet Muhammad, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, was infallible in regards to transmitting the message of Islam.   In regards to worldly things, he was right or wrong as any human might be, as can be seen in this hadith from Sahih Muslim:    Talha narrates: I was walking with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he passe...</answer>

        <answer>He was infallible, a man who was divinely guided.....    His victories, his teachings and his wonderful personality are just evidence to how infallible God made him. How could one man be successful against so much opression, so much hatred in such a troubled time at one of the most troubled places on earth?

        <answer>INFALLIBLE, sinless, he never sinned in his life, and if you want to say he use to walk like everyone else, well so is Jesus described in this way in the Quran, and then you say only Jesus was infallible. Muhammad was the highest rank out of all the prophets, the seal, in fact we believe all the prophets were infallible.

      <detail>I was. I was glad to see him again. But I do think Elizabeth was acting a bit weird around him. I know it's because she feels guilty for making love with Nik, but she really ought to come clean.      But I was thrilled to see Jonathan jackson again.   Last time I saw Jonathan Jackson was from the movie Dirty Dancing:Havana nights.      Now if only laura would return.......</detail>

        <answer>I HEART jonathan jackson! He was always the only Lucky to me, and I'm glad he has finally returned. I stopped watching after he left because it just wasn't the same. Hopefully the writers will be inspired by him and all of the fans to write some really good stuff! I agree we need Laura to return and the ORIGINAL Emily to return...then it will be like the good old days with the Fab 4! So excited for what's coming!</answer>
        <answer>I never saw him as the old Lucky, he seems like a wonderful actor, though...weird to see a spark btwn Liz and Lucky again, seemed like it was hard to cover up their connection.  His voice, is really soft, he seems more of a pretty boy, than a cop..and after being use to Greg V., it's gonna take a while to get use to, but I am looking forward to see what he can do for his character.</answer>
        <answer>Im very happy to see JK again but, I think he does not fit the role any more. He looks like him and Michael are around the same age. JK seems more weak and foolish. Now that Nickolas has his hands on both of the spencer dudes chicks I see the old family Freud coming back. Good thing Ethan will have Lucky's back cause Nick would have a field day with him.</answer>
        <answer>I was so glad to see JJ. I was smiling so hard. And the entrance was too cute. JJ still has that Lucky swagger and I hope...lord I hope the writers give Lucky his edge back. I really can't stand this whole storyline, but am glad to see JJ back. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Shout out to Greg Vaughn...he's a great guy, but the writer's just did a a disservice to the Lucky character during GV's run. I hope to see him on TV soon.</answer>
        <answer>I didn't watch GH regularly when JJ played Lucky, but when he appeared on yesterday's show, I was glued to the screen. I'm trying not to envision how Greg Vaughn would be playing the scenes, but I don't think it will take more than a day or so before I'm convinced JJ was Lucky all along. I look forward to flashbacks.</answer>

      <title>Is the boardroom in The Apprentice Alan Sugar's real boardroom?</title>
      <detail>Or is it just a set for the TV programme. If it is real, where is it?</detail>
      <category>Entertainment &amp; Music;Television;Reality Television</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>No it's not a real boardroom and nor do we see the whole session which really takes place there, only bits of it.  The parts where they leave the boardroom when fired are filmed beforehand too!  The tasks take place over several consecutive days but we see them all as separate tasks and the bit where they get the phone call at 6 am to say the car will call for them all in half an hour..........all fake too!</answer>
        <answer>It will be a real boardroom but Alan Sugar will no doubt have many different boardrooms. I wouldn't be surprised if that one was only used for the apprentice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's in London. It would be silly to have it anywhere else as the contestants are all living in london.</answer>
        <answer>It's filmed in the BBC Studios in White City</answer>

      <title>In Australia, what does this expression "F*CK OFF WE'RE FULL" on an illustration of Australia mean?</title>
      <detail>Does this mean Aussies don't want people from other countries living in Australia?   But I'm confused because aren't the people currently living there the people who immigrated there in the first place? So they're contradicting themselves now that they don't want people (who are like the first white settlers whether it'd be 10 years or 100 years ago) coming in?       Or does that expression just mean "white's only", if so doesn't a white person living in Australia have the same right as Chinese person to live there considering the country was neither belonging to each race? Most of the whites are generations from Irish convicts when the English settled in Australia 200 years ago.      So what does this really mean? I'm very confused. I see kids here in Australia putting up "F*CK OFF WE'RE FULL" signs on the internet, stickers on their lockers etc... Kid's that are Irish, Scottish, English etc...       Why wouldn't Aussies want people who are just like their older relatives to live here?</detail>
      <category>Travel;Australia;Other - Australia</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>It's all due to xenophobia. In the past decade Australia has had a lot of asian and middle easter immigrants. The sign you read is just another racist remark towards these people. Racism has been occurring in Australia since the first non-white immigrants arrived. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  This racism is all due to their ignorance and xenophobia, even though all Australians (except aboriginals) come from immigrant families.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Racism is a response to feeling threatened and a way of coping from xenopho...</answer>
        <answer>Do you feel the love? Yes, it is horrible and I see that sticker ALOT on cars here in Queensland. Just goes to show you that Australia has one of the most parochial attitudes I have ever witnessed. The sticker means that they don't want anyone ( regardless of colour ) immigrating here. They would prefer to only have Australian born ( as physicaly being born ) in this country. Very deep racist attitudes still lurking deep within the Aussie culture.</answer>
        <answer>They are morons who are against immigration. Race is irrelevant. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I think some of it is to do with those migrants who don't assimilate to the Australia way of live. It's like the 'love it or leave' expression.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  It's not that easy to get into Australia for permanent migration, so most people don't have a problem with it.</answer>
        <answer>The people who use car stickers like that are anti-immigrant they don't care where they come from, where as the rest of us (the vast majority) would prefer to live next to the immigrants than next to the redneck hicks with that type of attitude</answer>
        <answer>it the way of the aussie public to vent there anger of over population in the major cities&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  australia is a country if you mention immigration you are branded a racist :((&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  it was once the lucky country not anymore</answer>

        <answer>Well, I think you have a really good chance of getting in.&lt;br&gt;Those are great SAT scores, not to forget the MUNs and the APs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although I suggest you meet a counselor. Like for admissions and all. They'll charge you a bit but they're gonna be worth it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And do some social work, that would prove beneficial. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sure you give you TOEFL soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sure you act quickly, as the MIT application process starts in August and the earlier you apply, the better chances you have.</answer>
        <answer>If you keep this up you will most likely get in. You are extremely smart and I see you are motivated, and that's the kind of students MIT wants to have. Good luck :)</answer>

      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Travel;Asia Pacific;Malaysia</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>This bridge is not necessary. A ferry ride from Sumatera to Melaka and vice versa is only 2 hours away. The Singapore-Johor bridge is a must because a lot of activities ( involving both Malaysian and Singaporeans ) are going on between these two countries and many people travel to and forth between Johor and Singapore. However there is not much activities going on between Melaka and Sumatera. The only activities going on are Indonesian workers coming here and returning to their country. If this ...</answer>
        <answer>First let me just change your typo to bridge instead of bride then you wont get any more complaints. A total waste of money, why not do some thing for the many hard core poor. Let Fernande's worry about getting people to Sumatra and back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roads in many cities in Malaysia should be the concern, the pot holes, the bits of road missing and all the other hazards Malaysians have to contend with during their daily travel around their home towns. The money needs to be spent where it is needed no...</answer>
        <answer>that is the most stupid idea, they just want to do it so that they can makan duit that is the only logic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;how much they want to charge for the toll? how many people want to use it? would sumatra tourists afford to come here?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;it would take a few hundred years to get back the money, better use that money to repair our road, avoid flood, have a faster internet speed, better school, more university etc</answer>
        <answer>Very good idea. We could go to Indonesia by bridge very cheap. We could easily control the Straits Of Malacca from the pirates. More good from Indonesia will pour in such as fish,cattle, goat, chicken, various types of vegi, ulam-ulaman and so on. So we could get cheap prices from those food staff because all the taukey (Malay, Chinese and Indian) here are makan darah all the barang are very expensive even though the products are produce here in Malaysia.</answer>
        <answer>Stupidest idea from politicians who want to benefit from kickbacks more than anything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RM44Billion could do a lot to help the poor and average Joe in the country. These wealthy Ministers can't see the many Malaysian struggling to survive in the escalating Barang Naik country. How sad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give more aid to families and youths who are studying at tertiary level. Fees are so exorbitant. Provide free education up to university level, 50% grant to those in private colleges.</answer>

        <answer>well, if she is like 3/4 of the mexicans living in the states she doesnt speak english...so that iwll be a problem..wont be able to communicate especially with the kids she will be taking care of..and secondly, does she have her paperwork in order to live in the NL?..she cant just pop over a stay a year on a whim..longest she can stay is 90 days as a tourist</answer>
        <answer>I agree with blabla (once more!, hehe :) ) ...&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  But i would like to add that in the Netherlands there are plenty of spanish speaking people, including lots of mexicans, who are very much and very well integrated into the dutch society, so much that you never hear of issues about them... so in that case the nanny will be fine, hopefully she will also learn dutch which is very important as life is easier that way...</answer>

      <detail>Okay, so I'm in the south-western part of the U.S. (lt is early February) and when l look at the sky in the night-time I'm seeing a dot that sure doesn't look like a star.. I don't know if it is Mars or Venus, my  science teacher mentioned that we would be seeing the Hubble Telescope sometime but it would be hard for the fog that came over for a bit a while back.. idk.. anyone know what it is? Or if it is just a star?</detail>
      <category>Science &amp; Mathematics;Astronomy &amp; Space</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Mars is currently about the brightest object in the sky. Venus is too close to the Sun now to be observed. The Hubble Space Telescope is visible from your location low in the south, but hard to see. If you see something bright moving across the sky, it is most likely the International Space Station.</answer>
        <answer>I guess it's too much to ask what part of the sky? And what time of night?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The star people notice at this time of year is Sirius. The most prominent planet is Mars.</answer>
        <answer>check daily to see if it moves...if it moves a great distance over several nights, it's more likely Hubble. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If it's brighter than all the other stars, it's Venus</answer>
        <answer>Mars is bright (and red) in the east in the evening nowdays.</answer>

        <answer>The neighborhoods of Kerrisdale, Southlands and the West End are particularly attractive. Southlands have huge mansions which boasts one of the highest costs in the area. Kerrisdale feels a bit British. And the West End is a high-rise neighborhood right next to downtown, close to Stanely Park, entertainment, shopping and the beach. There are even suburb style houses which makes a great escape from the feeling of living downtown. Kitsilano is also great but expensive.</answer>
        <answer>There are a lot of really nice places to live within Vancouver, but some of them are not necessarily that cheap to live in. There are areas and communities within Vancouver such as Kerrisdale, Kitsilano, Marpole, Point Grey, Dunbar area, Mount Pleasant, Shaughnessy, and some other nice areas. If you're not wanting to spend a lot of money, you should look at areas like Richmond, Surrey, Delta, or areas like that which are not quite as expensive.</answer>

      <title>Why did Carthage use mainly Mercenaries?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Carthage was a city state,and its empire was a trading one rather than an outright territorial one.Carthage therefore needed a strong navy,and much of the city's available manpower went to crew its warships and merchant ships.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  This meant that there wasn't sufficient manpower available to maintain a large army,so Carthage used some of the wealth it got from its trading empire to hire mercenaries in wartime.</answer>
        <answer>Hannibal had a "standing army" at the start of the second Punic war. He didn't wait for war to break out before readying his forces but built them beforehand.&lt;br&gt;  There were two reasons why Carthage hired mercenaries. First, it had plenty of money to pay them, and it's a lot easier to hire someone else to do the fighting for you. Second, Carthage had a far smaller population than Rome plus its allies, so it had to hire many additional troops to have a good chance.</answer>
        <answer>&lt;a href="http://tiny.cc/02z3i" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tiny.cc/02z3i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This google search, second source is Nigel Bagnall's book on the Punic Wars.&lt;br&gt;  Page 16 has a quote from Diodorus describing what Carthage religion was like.&lt;br&gt;  Baal-Ammon might have inspired public displays of pride from sociopathic nobles, but sensible people would not be inspired to serve such a thing.  They'd have to hire outside labour for most of the service to Moloch.</answer>
        <answer>Because they didn't want to fund a standing army during times of peace. They had very accomplished generals, and only needed to hire mercenaries to serve under them during wartime.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Even Hannibal had an army of mercenaries, not a standing army</answer>
        <answer>Quite simply becasue they couldn't match Rome in terms of manpower, but could match in terms of cold hard cash.</answer>

        <answer>A 'smart buy' is another term for a lease with an option to buy at the end of the lease. The residual calculated on American cars is almost always way higher than the trade-in value, so you will not get anything. &lt;br&gt;  It's a total ripoff. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The only exception I can think of where you might be able to get something would be if you have had the car for 3 years and it is cherry with under 15K miles on it.</answer>

      <title>Do humans lose their individuality in Heaven and Hell?</title>
      <detail>Think about it...real hard thoughts, and give me an answer</detail>
      <category>Society &amp; Culture;Religion &amp; Spirituality</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Thinking....thinking.....thinking.....no... Heaven and hell are man made myths created by evil people to scare the crap out of people so that they behave and conform. You will lose your individuality when your heart stops supplying blood to your brain. It's lights out after that.</answer>
        <answer>How so?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  If Lucifer was able to decide on his own that he would rather rule in hell then serve in heaven, isn't that pretty strong evidence of individuality?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Also, IF this were so, then why do we keep our individuality when we become Christians?&lt;br&gt;  Yes, we do; the fact that we have different denominations, that people in a church do not always agree is proof of that.</answer>
        <answer>No ,if ones go to heaven they are the same person after all their personality and attitude is what got them there in the first place.However there is no gender in heaven. The ones resurrected from the grave or hell are the same people exactly as we knew before. Just as a carpenter can build a house exactly like the blue print so can God restore a human by the same DNA blueprint as before. How is that Science for ya?(Acts 2:31) he saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ...</answer>
        <answer>Certainly not...........&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;   “There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.  But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,  desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell[a] from the rich man’s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.  So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.  And being in torments in H...</answer>
        <answer>Yeah. If you live a 'Christian" life, all good and abstaining and whatnot, you have to do the same in heaven. Seeing as 87.3% of my life is 'sinful', I guess I'm moving to hell. I'd rather live in torment than suffer through a peaceful eternity in absolute denial of all things fun.</answer>

        <answer>Guatemala is a beautiful country. It has many wonderful things to visit- check out fodor's for the site seeing.

      <title>Where can I find records of public comment for Sheffield waste incinerator?</title>
      <detail>Hi, I'm trying to write a report about the waste incinerator in Sheffield, which was built in 2005. I would like to know what the political and social process of building the incinerator was like. I figure the company, Veolia, would have to apply for a permit, and then there would have to be a period where the public could comment, or maybe planning permission meetings the public could attend (and comment at).      I'm from the USA and so don't know how the process necessarily works in UK or where the records would be kept. Can anyone tell me 1) what sort of public comment process would apply for this type of installation, and 2) where I could find records of what the public said about giving permission to build the incinerator? (Preferably online)      Thanks!</detail>

      <answers>
        <answer>Yep. PCWorld actually rated the MBP the best Windows Vista computer in 2007. Har. But the number one feature is OS X. If you like Windows, OS X may feel backwards to you and you may never get used to it. For me, it's Windows that's backwards. Different strokes. Try one out at an Apple Store.    Yes, the MBP has a dedicated GPU. Currently an NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT 256MB or 512MB    Not DRM, but it's equally as illegal to install 1 license on more than one Mac.</answer>

        <answer>How about a tear from you for all that Saddam killed and tortured?  Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis slaughtered and tortured to death by Saddam.  Around a hundred thousand Kurds poisoned gassed by Saddam.  YOU HAVE VERY SELECTIVE TEARS.  (Your figure of 600,000 is incorrect.  It has been corrected to about 65,000 most who have been killed by insurgents, not Americans.)  Your opinion on Russia may be valid, but you need to correct your opinion on Iraq.</answer>

Although what you say about Iraq is true just because there is a smaller amount of suffering in other countries does not make that suffering any better nor should it be condoned. The situation in Iraq is terrible but it does mean that we don't notice other people's suffering. What about the people in Darfur for example?

But I think you're missing the bigger picture here and I speak not as a Clinton supporter (because I'm not) but as a citizen who expects a fair process where people are represented.    Look at it from this angle. Michigan, controlled by a Democrat run government, intentionally moved up its primary to snub the party's constant Iowa/New Hampshire first rule.

The Qur'an will disappear in one night, and no Ayah will be left on earth.

We said, "O Messenger of Allah! Will it be due to smallness of our numbers at that time?"

        <answer>Yes, as far as I know, it is true.  Mostly it talks about a time when Muslims are Muslims by name and not by action or deeds.  Sadly, it think the third paragraphs refers to the now.  The first two paragraphs are true but they will be during the last 50 years of the Earth's existence.  Soon after that, the Earth will be destroyed by God Almighty.</answer>
        <answer>yes , the first two hadiths are going to happen just before the judgement day , as for the third , i think it is so obvious for all to notice , muslims are fifth of the world and see how ppl treat them.    EDIT:there is still religion classes in egypt , may be it is not ,unfortunatly,taken seriously , but it is still.</answer>
        <answer>dear Judith,  the first two hadeeth/ hadith-s mention about few of many signs that will happen before qiyamah/ the judgment day.  the last hadith, sadly, happens for today's ummah/ community of muslims.  peace.</answer>

The cool thing about it is that the songs sound the same in the beginning and middle of each phrase but each take different turns on the end of each phrase.

      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Politics</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>We believe it is in Israel. The Rocky mountains was simply the prophesy by Joseph Smith that the mountains would become the safe haven for the LDS(mormons). Which it did. They moved to Utah back in 1847 to escape the religious persecutions that occurred in Missouri and Ohio. It is true that they considered Utah and the Rocky mountains their own "promised land" where they would be left alone, similar to how Moses and the Jews considered Israel their promised land.</answer>
        <answer>Although Israel is the original promised land, during the diaspora many Israelites were led away to "the isles of the sea", which includes the Americas.  The descendents of Lehi and Ishmael were promised that the Americas would be their inheritance, and that God would not forget them, but return them to their former beliefs after their long night of apostasy.  That is part of the mission of the Book of Mormon.</answer>

I have written the superclass and it as follows: /**  * A class that holds media items.  */ public class MediaItem{     private String title;     private int date;     private double cost;     public void setTitle(String title){         this.title = title;}      public void setDate(int date){         this.date=date;}      public void setCost(double cost){         this.cost=cost;}      public String getTitle(){         return title;}      public int getDate(){         return date;}      public double getCost(){         return cost;}      public String getMedia(){         String media;   //to hold the media         media= title+date+cost;             return media;} } I have made a media test driver and it as follows:  import java.util.Scanner; /**  * this program demostrates the mediaitem class  */ public class MediaItemdriver{     public static void main(String [] args){         String testTitle;       // to hold a title         double testDate;           // to hold a purtchase date         double testCost;        // to hold the cost of item         Scanner keyboard=new Scanner(System.in);         MediaItem media = new MediaItem();         System.out.println("Enter the title of the media item: ");         testTitle=keyboard.nextLine();         System.out.println("Please enter the cost of the item: ");         testCost=keyboard.nextDouble();         System.out.println("Please enter the date it was bought: ");         testDate=keyboard.nextDouble();        System.out.println("The media item is: " + media.getMedia());} }  I am getting the following error when running the mediadriver: java.util.InputMismatchException: null(in java.util.Scanner)  I am not sure what I have done wrong, and why I am getting this error. I think, and remeber I am a noob, that the program is looking for the next double, but no next double is to be found. any help..please..is greatly appreciated.</detail>

        <answer>Its what they call a Pro-Am event where Pros and amateurs play together in pairs and the total score for both (handicap calculated for the amateur celebrity) counts in one category while the professionals are individually scored without a handicap number (scratch) they stay in the predetermined pairs thru the whole weekend...while tom is one of the best celebrity golfers in that field that week he did not win...they do not compete directly (individually) against the professionals...I understand ...</answer>
        <answer>Perhaps shedding a little bit of light, Brady and his partner did not win. Phil Michelson (pro) and Harry You (amateur) won the pro-am event.with a combined score of -39 (which is derived from a combination of Phil's score in the pro event and Harry's in the amateurs', with handicap considered I believe). Brady played with Billy Andrade and his team didn't finish in the top 25.  They finished in a tie for 58th. The link below will provide the full scoop.</answer>

Saw only one black person in Feodosia, none in Simferopal, and a few more in Kiev.  You should be fine.   Use your head, stay away from lonely alleys after dark, take a good look in bars before going all the way in.  They like to get very drunk.

        <answer>I will agree with 2 responders below. Being native Ukrainian (as born there but living in the USA for 20 Years) I visited my homeland 2 times, last 2 years ago, People are getting looks there, prejudice is common, bigger city has more than smaller ones.  I tried not to look too different than natives were (the quality of clothing is better than here in the USA) more Europeans. I tried not show up as an American, for fright of being mugged or else.  Otherwise it is ok</answer>
        <answer>your question is too wide open. If you go to the theater or museums (both of which there are a lot of in both Russia and Ukraine) I doubt you would see even one. If yo go to the villages, you'll see fewer still.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;    In Kiev itself, it depends where you go. If you frequent a working man club where the patrons love heavy metal type music...guess what, you have skin heads. It's as safe as where you go, same as any big city.</answer>

Any opinions if I'd be wasting my time, or do I have a shot?  Be honest...  thanks.  Here's 3 pics of me, one with blonde hair, one with brown hair and kind of a blurry one of me flexing like a moron...but you can see my body at least.   http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh215...  http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh215...  http://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh215...</detail>
      <category>Entertainment &amp; Music;Magazines</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>I think you are prettiest with brown hair. If you have nice features and a good figure, and that's what you want to do, why not try out? I would go in with the attitude that "if I get it, I get it, if I don't, I don't." Don't let it affect your self-esteem. Plenty of beautiful girls try out and don't make it. If you don't, they might consider you for something else having to do with Playboy. Be pleasant and personable and have lots of personality. I hear they like that.</answer>
        <answer>Please just take these pictures off the internet and cultivate some self respect. You don't need anyone to judge you, but least of all some lecherous old farts who don't give a **** about you other than what effect viewing certain regions of your body have on their penises. And it is not your body you should be focusing on evaluating but your mind, heart and soul. Playboy and other magazines like it are misogynistic and sexist, degrading you to the status of an object. Please, take council with ...</answer>
        <answer>you look to young and not mature i highly doubt that they would even consider you . not to be mean but you probably wont make it you look average</answer>
        <answer>I say to give it a try. You never know what may happen. I regret not going for it, when I was your age. Stay positive, even if you don't end up being picked now, because you'll still have the chance again, you're young. Good luck to you and remember to enjoy the experience.</answer>
        <answer>You need to tone up a bit, but you have the basic shape.   Lots of beautiful girls are turned down...it's not just about the right look, but having the right look at the right time. If you show up as a beautiful curvy brunette but they are looking for a skinny blonde, it doesn't mean you aren't good enough, just means you have to keep trying. You don't try for Playboy once, many of us work at it over and over.</answer>

        <answer>Alicante is quite a large province so you have quite a large area to choose from. If you are particular about staying on the Coast and have a preference for nightlife that has a more Spanish flavour than English, then I would suggest that you look towards the Northern part of the Costa Blanca.&lt;br&gt;        Almost every part of the Costa will have a certain English feel to it, so I can only point you towards those areas that are less so than the rest.&lt;br&gt;       The Towns of Denia and Javea are abou...</answer>
        <answer>The thing is Alicante (the town) is not exactly an exiciting place, but more like a provincial small town where you won't find a lot of exciting clubs.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Valencia is a better choice imo, basically the same climate but a bigger city that has a lot more to offer during the day and a more intense night life.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Besides, if you're based in Alicante, it will be too far to go to other towns for a night out.

I was told by a source at Fort Hood (the closest Base to me) that he would need to 'contact JAG' but I wonder if that means when he gets to A-School or if he can somehow do that while at Boot Camp?</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Military</category>

      <title>What is NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Oranization)and what is its importance?</title>
      <detail>N/A</detail>
      <category>Politics &amp; Government;Military</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Being stationed in NATO twice and being a history nut, I can answer this...    First NATO was formed by the Allied Powers post WWII in order to keep up military ties and provide for common defense against an ever more aggressive Soviet presence in Eastern Europe.  The WARSAW PACT was created to counter the Soviet perceived threat of NATO which lasted until November 1989 when Germany reunified.    NATO continued as an organization post cold-war in order to maintain stability in the region (i.e. i...</answer>
        <answer>It is mainly a military organization to provide security for it's members. It's imortance? Well, the main rule in NATO is: "an attack against one member of NATO means an attack against all other members", and this means that all the countries-members support each other. For more official information check http://www.nato.int/ .</answer>
        <answer>NATO is a useless organization created to monitor world affairs. NATO was a good idea when it originated after World War II (correct me if Im wrong) to monitor foreign countries so that nothing like WWII would happen again. Now NATO is bogged down with political scandals, and a list of host nations trying to protect their butts from the U.S. finding out about all their dirty dealings with countries like Iran and North Korea.</answer>
        <answer>NATO is a group of nations, canada and america and western europe and lately they include some in eastern europe    the significance of NATO was that during the COLD WAR between the late 40s and early 90s there was NATO countries and WARSAW PACT countries which included the soviet union and east germany.    So the Nato countries would go to war if attacked by anyone else and the warsaw pact countries agreed to go to war if they were attacked by anyone    so the cold war was seen as the nato coun...</answer>
        <answer>Ya, NATO was an alliance by countries in the west (US, England, France, W. Germany, etc) to protect it against the countries in the East (Warsaw Pact) (USSR and it's buddies).  These were the sides for WWIII when it was going to be US v. USSR during the cold war.  NATO is mostly obsolete now.</answer>

      <category>Science &amp; Mathematics;Weather</category>

        <answer>Radar smoothing tends to delineate the image. It can effect resolution and cause individual intricacies within the cell to be missed. The NWS doesn't really have any products that I know of that smooth the image. Their are a few civilian programs that do though. Weathertap is a VERY good program but it is a subscription program. If you must have smoothed images for free then The weather channel has them, but they are usually a few scans old and, as stated above, lacking in resolution.</answer>

        <answer>that means heavier construction usually to carry more weight.   you probably want tyres optimally matched to  your vehicles design. you find your manufactures recommended tire fitment on the tire placard located on the drivers door or post, sometimes in the fuel door or glove box. 6 or 8 ply would be indicated by load range c or d . these heavier built tyres are usually only needed on heavier vehicles like camper vans and light trucks and some suv's. never use tyres rated to carry less weight th...</answer>
        <answer>The ply rating on a tyre relates to the stiffness of the tyre wall and the resistance to flattening under load. A tyre is made of various thin steel bands or belts wound with rubber and various resins. The stiffer the wall of the tyre, the higher the ply rating will be.An eight ply tyre would normally be used on a large van or trailer.</answer>

      <title>Sugar-Free Candy?</title>
      <detail>is there any sugar-free candy or chocolate that doesn't contain that certain ingredient that causes diarrhea if you eat a lot? i forget the name of the ingredient, but its a laxative of some sort that replaces the sugar taste.</detail>
      <category>Health;Diseases &amp; Conditions;Diabetes</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Sugar free candy contains sugar alcohols which aren't good for diabetics either. Your best option would be to eat a piece of candy if you like and simply include this in your carb count.</answer>
        <answer>It is probably aspartame, but you should not eat a lot of anything if you are diabetic.</answer>
        <answer>It's sorbitol.  You'll need to read the ingredient labels to make sure the product you choose doesn't contain sorbitol.    One of my students had a diabetic-information booth at a health fair.  She had sorbitol candies there, and she snacked on them all day despite my warning.  The next day she said, "I wondered what was wrong with me!"</answer>
        <answer>If your getting close then you need to be on a diabetic  diet. Because pastas and other foods make sugar even though there is no sugar in them, so please consult your doctor or nutritionist and  get on the proper diet NOW. If you wait you could be in for a long and painful ride. I had a roommate who was diabetic and did not take care of his diet.....dead at age of 28...heart attack. My father took insulin everyday and tried to eat properly....poor circulation in feet and legs, numerous kidney an...</answer>
        <answer>Nope, unfortunately not yet.  Sorbitol is in most "sugar-free" foods other than liquids, and it has carbs in it, so don't bother.  Just eat moderate portions of the sugared stuff.</answer>

        <answer>20-25</answer>
        <answer>Typical age for first year college students is 18-19.  But you can fit in anywhere as long as you try to make friends.  I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Worst case you have friends that are further along in their education as you but the same age.  In college age really doesn't matter near as much as attitude.  You will find friends that lead the same type of lifestyle that you do age is really not a factor in that.</answer>

        <answer>Well, there are people working there, in the offices and stuff. They are not necessarily members of the clergy, and they live there with their families.  For example, Emanuela Orlandi, a girl who disappeared in 1983 on her way to school.

In this one they go up to 70,000 feet.&lt;br&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJoMDq4AyLc&amp;feature=related</answer>
        <answer>You can find lots of videos of the SR-71 on YouTube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aircraft looks the same in supersonic flight as it does in subsonic flight. For photo sessions, it's easier to photograph it at subsonic speed, since a chase plane needs to keep up with it. At its full speed, only another SR-71 would be able to take pictures, and it's very difficult to take pictures from an SR-71 because the cockpit is very cramped (not to mention the huge expense of using another SR-71 as a chase plane).</answer>

        <answer>NO</answer>
        <answer>I can't read abreviations I've never seen before.</answer>
        <answer>1.  It's not up to Obama whether to fund those programs at all; it's up to Congress.  All three programs were created by statutes passed by Congress.  The President is not an emperor, so he can't just abolish them.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  2.  No Republican President or Congress ever got rid of them, either.  And TVA has existed for more than 70 years--through both conservative and liberal administrations.  For some reason conservatives think federal programs "over reach" only when the other party is in the W...</answer>
        <answer>Of course.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Only 10% of the NPR budget comes from the federal government through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The rest comes from member station dues, foundation grants, and corporate underwriting.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The federal funding for the NEA represents about 0.00004% of the federal budget. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The TVA receives absolutely NO federal funding, depending rather on revenues from its energy business to fund all components of its mission:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.tva....</answer>

      <title>Dan White murdured (assassinated) mayor, George Moscone and Harvey Milk. What led him to do this?</title>
      <detail>As the title already asks, why did Dan White murder &amp; assassinate mayor, George Moscone &amp; gay activist, Harvey Milk?</detail>
      <category>Travel;United States;San Francisco</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Dan White resigned in 1977, I believe, but in 1978 he wanted his position at the San Francisco, California &amp; mayor's building, back but George Moscone refused. This led Dan White to assassinate the San Francisco mayor, George Moscone &amp; gay rights activist, Harvey Milk (that had his position).</answer>
        <answer>Here is one article in retrospect about the reasons for the act after Dan White killed himself in prison. He served only 5 years or so for these murders because there were no gay rights then.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/22/us/dan-white-killer-of-san-francisco-mayor-a-suicide.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/22/us/dan…&lt;/a&gt;</answer>
        <answer>this is not a travel question.</answer>
        <answer>There is a movie named Milk that you may want to watch. The answer before mine pretty much says what happened.</answer>
        <answer>First off Harvey Milk did not hold Dan Whites seat on the Board of Supervisors, he was elected to his own seat.  He had made a few previous attempts to sit on the Board prior to getting his own seat.  San Francisco went from city wide elections, to district elections and Milk was able to win his district.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  White resigned his position when he felt the Board as a whole did not support any of his positions, he was after all pretty conservative compared to the rest of the make up of the bo...</answer>

        <answer>The book begins in 1814, when Napoleon is in exile on the isle of Elba. In the book, Edmond Dantes is imprisoned for unknowingly conspiring with the Emperor. While Dantes is in prison, Napoleon escapes, takes back France, goes to war again with Britian and Prussia, is defeated for good the next year in 1815. Dantes remains in jail for several years, then finally escapes. Thus the book takes place 1814 probably to about the 1840s or 1850s or so.

The Chicago Bulls were the laughing stock of the league until Rod Thorn drafted MJ.

        <answer>Jordan is the greatest...For now.  Give LeBron a few more years to pile up championships and MVP's and we will crown a new king.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  But nobody changed the game more than MJ.  He took his one weakness, defense, and became the defensive player of the year.  Who else has rock solid numbers that make them better than Jordan?</answer>
        <answer>In real estate it's location,location,location. &lt;br&gt;  In MJ's case stats no longer matter.&lt;br&gt;  Anyone who understands BB can understand Jordan. &lt;br&gt;  It's kind of like JC in the year 0. You either accept or you don't. If you have ever really seen him play you to would understand.&lt;br&gt;  I suppose this is  deep answer but sometimes stats do lie.

        <answer>Luckily, you have lots of time!    Good (very good) grades are a must.  If your school offers weighted credits for certain activities or classes, seriously consider whether they'd be beneficial - I don't recommend doing them *just* for the weighted credits, but investigate.    Take the technical/academic path where it's available.  Do other things too - sports, volunteer work, jobs that don't involve french fries if possible (although they know that whether this is possible depends largely on wh...</answer>

        <answer>"APS" stands for Advanced Photo System. It was jointly developed by Kodak, Fuji, Nikon, Canon and 1 more company I can't think of right now. It was designed to be an easy alternative to replace films like 110 and 126.   It is a smaller negative than 35mm film and has the same problems as any other small negative film. The more you enlarge it, the grainier it appears. You can select 3 different print sizes from it (4x6 (C), 4x7(H) which is its full frame and 4x12(P)) but realistically the camera ...</answer>
        <answer>APS qualifies in traditional terms as  a  "subminiature" film format.    Yet, APS  probably delivers better print quality than any subminiature format, EVER.</answer>
        <answer>It's a kodak film, the negatives are smaller than 35mm and they are kept inside a cartridge instead of being cut and loose like in 35mm, on the camera you can select (i think it's) 3 different sizes, but you should just use normal since it can be changed to any size (including panorama) in the photo lab, it's kodak so the quality would be the same as regular kodak film, if you take your pictures to a really small photo lab they might not be able to do them since you have to have a little device ...</answer>

        <answer>I agree with you. I did think it was strange that on her special day, she chose not to wear a wig. As you say, she had false eyelashes, eyebrows and eyeliner on - along with make up, fake tan etc, so why not look as best as possible.

I am in 2 honor societies at my school and spanish club and the future business leaders of america (FBLA).  I play tennis  Don't have a job yet...should i get one?  I volunteer at a hospital and in the community  Going to take an internship this summer   Also, does the major you want to go into make a difference to them,   if you live in state and   does being a minority help or hurt you in the admission process?        </detail>

      <answers>
        <answer>yes, you are on track.</answer>
        <answer>Major doesn't matter  Living in state doesn't matter because they aren't state schools (like UCLA)  You don't NEED a job...you have a lot of extracurriculars, which is good.  Being a minority doesn't hurt. It may or may not help.  You're on track in every way but your test score...the AVERAGE ACT at Northwestern is a 31, so to be a really good candidate, you should get above a 30...for USC, the average is a 30, so you should get around that as well. </answer>
        <answer>First of all, you are doing great and are on the right track, just keep on doing good on your courses, and make sure you perform well on the SAT/ACT. I am currently a graduate USC student, majoring in Computer Science, and I also did my undergrad at USC. I am an in-state, latino student, so I hope I can help.    Do not worry about getting a job, you should probably look for something where you can keep on volunteering, but also take the time to enjoy your summer.     Major does make a difference...</answer>

      <detail>This is what the game said in a interview    "I'm too disrespectful for Jay-Z, I go to hard. His beef is mediocre beef, it's more swag and less hardcore. Me, I go in on your grandma, your kids and your girl.it will get ugly and I don't mind. I have a whole coast to back me. My coast will turn their backs on whoever I turn my back on. So basically, let me commit suicide because I'm the only cat to commit suicide and resurrect every time. So for Jay to say that about me, that's cool man because he's Jay-Z and I'm just lil ol' Game. But if you fk with me I'll turn to a beast, and ill rip ya head off..bust ya lips," Game said.     What are your thoughts and who do you think is better?  </detail>

        <answer>I think that Game shud relax, and realize greatest when he see it. Game don't wanna get in to a beef wit Jay, cuz Jay will hit Game wit hiz, wat he think iz Jay'z less then hardcore lyrics. And then Game is gonna be lookin like a *** cuz he will lose wat  Game think is Jay's mediocre beef  </answer>
        <answer>is he serious! Jay-Z is a freaking legend. I don't even like his music much, but u have to respect him as a leader in rap right now. what has he been rapping for like 10 years. The game has to wait at least 5 years B4 he can even think about aiming at Jay. But this isnt new. the little new man around always wants to go after the top dog in order to get a little buzz. By the way didnt game use to b a stripper?</answer>
        <answer>I think this is hilarious. Game might sound half decent next to some of the crap that's being put out just now, but if he thinks that puts him on Jay's level, he's dellusional.

I was just wondering if you can kayak at the beach. We used to do it but my dad paddled so I don't know how hard it is to paddle. Would it be to hard for a 15 year old girl to paddle at the beach?

We took then to an unused section. There are 'surf kayaks' but without waves they are no fun. Buy a regular 'slalom' or 'river' canoe.

If there is a coaching program connected to it for additional money then it is just a scam that may or may not help you.

      <title>Are there Musical Theatre Songs Like 'Why God Why?' in Miss Saigon for Baritones?</title>
      <detail>There are so many great musical theatre tenor songs out there, like: Why God Why, and Maria. Are there any songs as fantastic as these for baritones? I know of Stars, and Soliloquy, are there others?      Although I have a large range (F2-F5), my best timber is in baritone range. Because of this, I'd like the chance to take on some really great baritone songs.</detail>

        <answer>I think I know what you are talking about. It's the netting that you put over your head to keep mosquitoes and black flies from biting when you are out fishing or camping and such.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  What I can tell you is that black fly season usually starts in June and goes until early July. They started earlier this year in some parts of Eastern Canada because of the really warm spring we had.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Mosquitoes are a nuisance all summer long, and are present more often where you have pools of sta...</answer>
        <answer>HAHAHAHA. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Cape Breton Island is one of he most beautiful places on this earth. Of course there are bugs everywhere in the world, so keep your big repellent close. but you don't need a bee keeper's mask.</answer>
        <answer>A little bit of bug spray is likely all you need, and when you leave , you can leave the half full can behind for some one else. Unless you are deep into the woods or near swamps on a hike , the bugs aren't bad. We are an Island, surrounded by ocean, so we always have lots of breezes and that means we usually have few bugs .</answer>
        <answer>I've been through Cape Breton several times, and never even saw a bug hat/beekeeper's veil.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  As has been said, there are bugs everywhere, but by the coastal areas, you likely will find very few biting insects, if any.</answer>

        <answer>You can't make purple with what you have and only using 2 of the colors. Unfortunately, you need red, a primary color, to mix with blue which will give you purple. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  The only other option would be to try and mix a dark orange-red with the yellow and perhaps try mixing it with the blue, but I doubt the result will be spectacular.</answer>
        <answer>Purple is made with Blue and Red.  However, you do not have red as a color choice, so I do not know how you would make the color purple out of Blue, Green, Orange and Yellow.</answer>

      <title>If Becks didn't play for United, would he become as popular as today?</title>
      <detail>If he didn't won the tripple ??? , and without Sir Alex Ferguson ???</detail>
      <category>Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>The questions should be more like:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  "If Becks didn't marry Victoria, would he become as popular as today?"&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  I remember when SAF made a comment of how humble and down-to-earth Becks was until he started going out with Victoria and it changed him, made him stand out from quieter ones like the Nevilles, Giggs, Scholes and Butt</answer>
        <answer>Good Question..&lt;br&gt;    Becham got himself to United so it is a good guess that without them he would have found success elsewhere.</answer>
        <answer>I think Beckham is definitely a hard working and dedicated professional but I believe it was Fergie and United who made him and taught him how to stay on top and he has just continued this wisdom and experience on from them.  I think United definitely made him the star he is now, without a shadow of a doubt.</answer>
        <answer>Of course not, but he has said that plenty of times already.&lt;br&gt;  He owes them the world and he has admitted that. That's why he and his kids still are big fans of United and he says in every press conference that SAF is the biggest football genius.</answer>
        <answer>K Morgan has never seen Beckham play obviously.... 5-15 years ago he was unstoppable</answer>

Try Port Hood, Chimney Corner . A couple of years ago, we were in the water in early October, that was a fluke. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  This is an odd year for weather.

      <detail>I think it should be the reverse because St. Anthony of Padua was born in the year 1180 A.D.,making him 1,180 years younger than Jesus Christ,who,of course,is 1,180 years older!It doesn't make any sense!Who's idea was it to make such pictures?And what was their point?</detail>
      <category>Arts &amp; Humanities;History</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Here's my own, perhaps novel, interpretation.    First of all, consider the book (I've also seen representations of Anthony of Padua holding a book with the Christ Child standing on the book).  Anthony was a scholar, known for his defense of "orthodox" Catholicism against heretics.  He was even called "The Hammer of Heretics."  So, the book symbolizes his learning and erudition.    Depicting Jesus as a child was, I think, in order to underline Anthony's role as a defender of the Catholic faith. ...</answer>

        <answer>I'm just guessing here--but:    The anachronistic portrayal of Jesus as an infant is symbolic.  Jesus might be said to represent different things at different stages during his life.  The baby Jesus and the dying Jesus are two very distinct symbols.  (Just picture them, if you care to, and notice that the images elicit very different emotional responses.)    In religious art, Christian symbols are often treated with as much license as the symbols of other mythologies, for the simple purpose of m...</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>It depends on what your field is and how much you have achieved in it. The NEA almost never gives grants to individuals anymore as a consequence of the political controversies of the early 1990's (see the US Supreme Court case NEA vs. Finley [2nd link below] for background info). The grants they give are typically to arts organizations like museums and theater companies, which is why what you do and how recognized you are in doing it matters so much.</answer>

      <title>Was Harvey Milk so ahead of his time since we're still debating about gay rights today?</title>
      <detail>In 2009 Harvey Milk was awarded posthumously with a Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition for his fight for gay rights.   Harvey Milk's last campaign before his assassination was pushing for Californians to not pass Prop 6 or "Brigg's Initiative." Brigg's Initiative would have fired all gay teachers and anyone that supported gay rights. Ronald Reagan, a former governor, opposed this initiative citing infringement on individual rights and so did many Democrats. Milk attended every single one of Briggs meetings and even engaged in a live televised debate with him over gay rights.   This was how Milk viewed the gay rights struggle vis a vis the Briggs' Initiative:  "On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country ... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives."  Here is another quote on his perspective of future gay-straight relations: "Even if gays lose in these initiatives, people are still being educated. Because of Anita Bryant and Dade County, the entire country was educated about homosexuality to a greater extent than ever before. The first step is always hostility, and after that you can sit down and talk about it."</detail>

      <detail>A girl i know found out someone they are now involved with,( that was in love with me in the past) still thinks he has a thing for me even though i told her nothing is going on anymore. A mutual friend told to me that she vents her anger/jealousy  using answers and then answers question with multiple screen names and signs them with my name or things significant to my family so that when he signs (he uses answers to) on and reads them he thinks it is me to get something started.  I wish to do nothing to hurt this person and wish she knew this. I am not perfectand made mistakes in the past but I just want to move on and wish she would just ask me any questions she might have.

        <answer>The green drink was absinthe.  The poison he added was laudenum, a derivative of opium. Remember how he was in the opium den in the beginning?  A lot of opium addicts at the time would take laudenum as a substitute.  Thats the way you'd take it .  The sugar cube he melted in was to cut the bitter taste.</answer>

He was always able to adapt his game to his age (shooting and hitting more jump shots, saving himself for the 4th quarter, etc..) and there was nothing anyone could do to stop him. His amazing offensive game overshadowed his awesome defensive stature (All-Defensive Team 9x, Led league in steals 3x, 2nd all-time in steals). Even though Pipp...</answer>

I would say 13 to 14 seconds is definitely on par for 13 year old males of reasonable athletic ability.

The Williams was a good best of the rest car but no race winner when judged against the competition.&lt;br&gt;  Williams had to wait until 2001 before they made their beastly powerful F1 racer.

        <answer>True because Juan Pablo couldn't make it in F1 and he went to NASCAR.  JPM is a good driver but didn't have the heart or the determination to make it in F1.</answer>
        <answer>Button is an okay driver. I don't think he is as quick as the A caliber drivers of F1. Maybe his experience is getting the best out of him. However, I'm an Alonso and Kimi fan.</answer>

        <answer>Everything done with the vegetation, animals, and machines were all 100% CGI. However, for the Na'vi people, James Cameron came up with a revolutionary technology he named "Motion Capture Filming." This technique involves getting the actors in suits with markers on them, so the cameras track their movements, including all of the tiny details, muscles, and skin movements of the face.

      <category>Sports;Cycling</category>
      <answers>
        <answer>Keep your tires at 80 psi.  I assume you mean cinder trails and bike paths.  Reducing the pressure on these tires will not make them more durable or ride better.  The sidewalls  are designed for a pressure range and you are right in the middle of that range now.</answer>
        <answer>Take them down to about 60 psi but....You do not want to use this tire off road if you value your bike and your life! http://wheelworld.com/itemdetails.cfm?ID... This is your tire and its intended use is for ROAD ONLY! This tire has no tread whatsoever and if you even take these on hardpack or dirt as its known you will slip in the turns and loose control of the bike fast! If you are looking for a dislocated collar bone go right ahead and use these tires on dirt! Edit: Yes McG is correct, I jump...</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>A lot of good questions.  It is always a good idea to have good fundamentals before advancing to more technical or skillful level of any sports.  At least that usually determines how far you can progress.  I am sure the best players and teams in the world have access to the newest innovative and scientific sport program.  It is not cheap, so it tends to be secretive and not shared with the public.  To promote a certain sport, you have to attract young players and make it fun to play and watch.  ...</answer>

      <answers>
        <answer>It's not just their fans who have been saying it, but many of the analysts on the networks.  It's the same old story, though - they see a decent defense and some solid running backs, and they fall in love with that particular team.    The Jags' D is good, and will keep them in the playoff hunt.  The passing game, though, even with a healthy Garrard is not strong.  I know that people love to stress the ability to run, but it just doesn't hold true in today's NFL.  If the Jags can't pass, then tea...</answer>
